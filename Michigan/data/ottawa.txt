Help Our Community Avoid a Spike in COVID-19 Cases!
As more and more places are reopening and restrictions are being lifted on gatherings, please keep in mind we are still in the COVID-19 pandemic. We don't want to lose the progress we've been making! We know the virus spreads much easier when people congregate, especially when the health and safety guidelines are not being followed.
Positive COVID-19 cases have increased across the country where restrictions have been lifted, as seen in Florida, Arizona and California. Increases in cases are likely a combination of different factors, of which, following health and safety guidelines is a very important one. Click here and select a state to view its data and increased positivity rates.

Cloth face coverings are an additional step to help slow the spread of COVID-19 when combined with every day preventive actions and social distancing in public settings. 
However, we know wearing one may be difficult for some people. Please be courteous to others who may have trouble wearing a face cloth covering.












Who should NOT use cloth face coverings: children under age 2, or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance

Cloth face coverings are NOT surgical masks or N-95 respirators.  Surgical masks and N-95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended in CDC guidance.









Wear your Face Covering Correctly

Wash your hands before putting on your face covering
Put it over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin
Try to fit it snugly against the sides of your face
Make sure you can breathe easily

Use the Face Covering to Protect Others

Wear a face covering to help protect others in case you’re infected but don’t have symptoms
Keep the covering on your face the entire time you’re in public

Don’t put the covering around your neck or up on your forehead

Don’t touch the face covering, and, if you do, wash your hands

Take Off Your Cloth Face Covering Carefully, When You’re Home

Untie the strings behind your head or stretch the ear loops
Handle only by the ear loops or ties
Fold outside corners together
Place covering in the washing machine (learn more about how to wash cloth face coverings)
Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth when removing and wash hands immediately after removing.

The COVID-19 Pandemic is NOT Over
Governor Whitmer’s Executive Order 2020-115 permits the re-opening of most business facilities and other gatherings, with some restrictions, as a part of the Michigan Safe Start Plan. However, we know the risk of being exposed and spreading COVID-19 is still present in our community. We also know that certain factors (like frequency of interactions, length of interactions and proximity to other people) among others can increase one’s risk of exposure to COVID-19. We continue to recommend each person and organization review and follow the mitigation guidance put forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to reduce risk.

The Ottawa County Food Safety team is reminding everyone that masks are still required under executive orders and are an effective way to limit the spread of COVID-19. Please continue to protect your food service employees, cashiers, custodians and other people in the public that you may come in contact with when you leave your house. Food Service Establishments licensed by Ottawa County have been issued information about reopening requirements. Some important requirements include daily illness screenings, regular disinfecting, mask use, social distancing and written plans for COVID-19 response.
If you are a customer or other member of the public who has concerns about a restaurant’s procedures, please visit www.miottawa.org/food.

Buyer BewareHow to Avoid Scams, Fraud & Rumor During an Emergency
When a disaster or emergency affects a community, it’s normal for the people in that community to come together. Many people go out of their way to care for each other and find ways to get involved. But other people may try to profit off or take advantage of people’s fear and anxiety. The amount of scams has risen since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Reports to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) show that scams have cost the public millions since the beginning of January. READ MORE
How to protect yourself & others
As scammers and fraudsters get more advanced in their planning and execution, it’s important that everyone be careful. Here are some tips from the Federal Communications Commission to help you protect yourself from scams, including coronavirus scams:


Protect important paperwork and keep personal information secure. That includes never sharing your personal or financial information through email, text messages, or over the phone.

Don’t open or respond to calls, texts, or emails from unknown senders. Scammers often spoof phone numbers to trick you into answering or responding. Spoofing makes it appear as if their phone call is coming from a known or trusted phone number or familiar geographic location.

Be cautious if you’re being pressured to share personal information over email or the phone. Government agencies will never call you to ask for personal information or money.

Hover over links (hold the mouse cursor) sent to you in an email or text message. If anyone sends you a text or email with a suspicious link and spelling errors, or if the message just seems out of character for the sender (maybe a friend or family member), call them to make sure they weren’t hacked.

Do your homework: Check to make sure a charity is legitimate by calling them or looking at its actual website before donating.

Report COVID-19 and other disaster-related scams to the National Center for Disaster Fraud at 866-720-5721 or disaster@leo.gov.

Governor Whitmer Signs Executive Orders Reopening More Regions, Economic Sectors Under MI Safe Start Plan
Northern Michigan, Upper Peninsula Regions Move to Phase 5 on June 10; Personal Care Services Including Salons, Barber Shops Reopen Statewide on June 15 
Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed Executive Orders 2020-114 (Safeguards to Protect Michigan's Workers) and 2020-115 (Temporary Restrictions) to reopen more regions and economic sectors under the MI Safe Start Plan. Starting on June 10, Regions 6 and 8 — which include much of northern Michigan and all of the Upper Peninsula — will advance to Phase 5 (Containing) of the governor’s MI Safe Start Plan. Phase 5 allows the reopening of salons, movie theaters, and gyms, subject to safety protocols and procedures designed to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

On June 15, personal services including hair, massages, and nails will reopen statewide. Though the remaining regions, 1 through 5 and 7, will remain in Phase 4 (Improving) under the executive orders, the governor said she expects the entire state will advance to Phase 5 in the coming weeks. Ottawa County is in Region 2.

Under Phase 5, indoor social gatherings and organized events of up to 50 people are permissible. Outdoor social gatherings and organized events are also allowed if people maintain six feet of distance from one another and the gathering consists of no more than 250 people. In addition, outdoor performance and sporting venues will be open with a larger capacity limit of 500, which will allow for some outdoor graduation ceremonies. READ MORE

Message from the Ottawa County Food Safety Team
Restaurants and bars are permitted to open dining spaces 




Under Executive Order 2020-110, restaurants and bars reopened on June 8. You can expect things to look a little different if you choose to visit a restaurant or bar:

Restaurants and bars can only operate at 50% of their indoor limit.
Guests must sit six feet away from other parties - this includes indoor and outdoor seating.
Guests may not wait for seating inside the restaurant. If waiting for takeout food, guests must be six feet apart.
Masks are required for servers and cashiers (front of the house staff). 
Some restaurants may find innovative solutions to temporarily expand seating outdoors. This will be permitted by the health department, as long as the food remains protected and all food and drink preparation occurs indoors.

Please contact us with specific questions or concerns.

EGLE provides guidance on flushing plumbing at businesses and facilities prior to restarting operations
The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) is reminding property managers throughout the state to be prepared to properly flush the plumbing of facilities that have been temporarily closed in response to the state’s efforts to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Statewide efforts to slow the spread of the virus have resulted in the closure or limited use of many buildings, such as restaurants and other businesses. This can lead to low or no use of water in these facilities. Water that sits unmoving in building plumbing for extended periods is at increased risk for leaching of metals (such as lead), reduced effectiveness of water treatment chemicals and bacterial growth.
Building owners or managers should proactively manage their building’s water quality. Proper flushing of building plumbing before reopening is important to maintaining water quality. Flushing removes stagnant water from all areas of the building. This requires running water through all fixtures long enough to bring fresh water into the plumbing system. If possible, building plumbing should be periodically flushed during the period of closure. A thorough flushing of building plumbing should occur in the days before reopening. There are several actions building owners and property managers can take prior to reopening - READ MORE

Michigan resumes deposit bottle, can returns
This month, Michigan consumers can begin redeeming bottles and cans that they have collected during the temporary, COVID-related shutdown of retail deposit rooms. Per State of Michigan Treasury Department guidelines, all supermarkets with Reverse Vending Machines located at the front of the store, or housed in a separate area, must accept deposit container returns on or before June 15.
Due to the large number of containers consumers are storing, temporary restrictions on returns may occur. Because of this, consumers are encouraged to check with their local retailers before returning containers.
Retailers may take any or all of the following steps to help with the influx of containers:

Limit the number of beverage containers that may be returned by a single individual per day to a deposit refund amount of $25.
Establish special or limited hours of operation for bottle return facilities.
Limit the number of available and operating reverse vending machines.
Periodically close bottle deposit facilities as needed for cleaning and supply management.
Implement such other procedures or restrictions as each retailer may determine are necessary or advisable to promote safety and/or efficiency.

However, people can also do walk-up if they bike or walk in or if organizations want to bring groups in by van or bus.
Where
West Ottawa High School Campus – entrance off Butternut Drive
When
Saturday, June 6 from 8:30 AM to 3:30 AM & Sunday, June 7 from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM
Why
This event helps public health officials identify COVID-19 infection in our community, isolate positive cases and find close contacts for follow-up monitoring. Some people with COVID-19 do not have symptoms and don’t know they have it. They can continue spreading the virus and can cause serious illness in others. This event will provide testing for them and many others. People who live in the 49424 ZIP code and those of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in Ottawa County. The location of this testing site was selected to facilitate testing for those two groups so we may detect and protect.
The National Guard will do the testing. Medical Reserve Corps volunteers and Ottawa County employees will provide support functions (instructions, forms, traffic control, data entry, etc.)



Governor Whitmer Rescinds Safer at Home Order, Moves Michigan to Phase Four of the MI Safe Start Plan 



Retailers, restaurants will be permitted to open with capacity limits, social distancing 



Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-110, rescinding her Safer at Home order and moving the entire state to phase four of the MI Safe Start Plan. The governor’s order will allow retailers to reopen on June 4 and restaurants to reopen on June 8, both subject to capacity limits. Day camps for children will likewise be permitted to open on June 8. Effective immediately, groups of 100 or less will be allowed gather outdoors with social distancing. Office work that is not capable of being performed remotely can resume. And in-home services, including house cleaning services, can resume operations. 



"The data has shown that we are ready to carefully move our state into the next phase of the MI Safe Start Plan, but we owe it to our brave frontline heroes to get this right,” said Governor Whitmer. “While Michiganders are no longer required to stay home, we must all continue to be smart and practice social distancing, and encourage those who meet the criteria to get tested for COVID-19. If we all do our part, our goal is to announce a shift to phase five for the entire state prior to the fourth of July. Stay smart, stay safe, and let’s all do our part.”   



Michiganders must continue to wear facial coverings when in enclosed public spaces and should continue to take all reasonable precautions to protect themselves, their loved ones, and the community. And they should continue to work from home to the maximum extent possible. 



“The governor and I, along with a team of experts, have determined that our state is ready to move into the next phase of the MI Safe Start Plan. Hospitalization numbers are down, our frontline workers have PPE to last them several weeks, and the number of positive cases and deaths are declining,” said MDHHS Chief Deputy for Health and Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun. “We will continue to monitor the data and work closely with local health departments to ensure Michiganders practice safe social distancing. On behalf of our health care professionals and first responders on the front lines, we must all be smart and be safe.”

Note from the Ottawa County Food Safety Team
Not all restaurants may choose to open on June 8. All restaurants will be required to complete a COVID-19 Reopening Plan before reopening. The specific requirements for restaurants will be communicated by OCDPH to their licensed establishments via email and will be available on our website. Facilities that may not open at this time include theaters, cinemas, performance venues, bowling alleys, indoor recreation facilities, arcades and other recreation or entertainment facilities. Licensed food establishments should contact their inspector with any questions.

Campgrounds Re-opening
Ottawa County outdoor campgrounds can now open but they need a plan in place for increased cleaning of common areas and explore as many ways as they can to physical distance (such as remote check-in procedures if possible). For more information, please contact the campground you are interested in attending.

New online dashboard provides COVID-19 risk and trend data, helps inform MI Safe Start plan  

A new, online dashboard launched today that visually illustrates COVID-19 risks and trends in Michigan, providing residents with important information about the pandemic status where they live and work. Developed through a collaboration between the Michigan departments of Health and Human Services and Labor and Economic Opportunity and the University of Michigan, dashboard data is divided into Michigan Economic Recovery Committee (MERC) regions. 
MERC regions were developed by merging Michigan's Emergency Preparedness Regions and Michigan's labor sheds – the major areas of the state where people live and travel to work based on U.S. Department of Labor data – so that any outbreak resulting from a return to work could be handled effectively under public health laws.

MDHHS Expands COVID-19 Testing Criteria to  Better Protect Residents

Greater access is important as Michigan reopens state economy
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) announced today it is greatly expanding testing criteria for COVID-19 to provide access to additional residents who do not have symptoms but are at risk. 
The new criteria includes asymptomatic patients who are preparing for surgery if testing is deemed necessary by the treating health professional. It also includes asymptomatic people who have known exposure to someone who has COVID-19 or symptoms, or who work in a profession that puts them at high risk of exposure due to close contact with the public, such as dental technicians, or to COVID-19 outbreaks in certain industries like at food processing facilities

Approximately 350,000 Michigan families will continue to have access to additional food assistance benefits in the month of May in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov.

Michigan Announces Change in Reporting of COVID-19 Testing Data 

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) today changed the way it reports data on COVID-19 testing. The change makes the data more accurate and relevant as the state continues to expand diagnostic testing to help slow and contain the spread of COVID-19. The update to the website separates out the results of two different types of tests – serology and diagnostic. Michigan – along with some other states – has not separated data for diagnostic and serology tests. 
Data on serology testing – also known as antibody testing – is separated from the other testing numbers. Currently, serology testing can be used to help determine whether someone has ever had COVID-19, while traditional viral diagnostic tests determine if someone has active disease.

Deceased Cases

Case Comparisions
Ottawa County’s weekly test counts have increased substantially over the last three weeks. This has enabled us to find more positive cases in the county. To flatten the curve we must continue to identify new cases and have them isolated and their contacts quarantined. The positivity metric displayed on the data dashboard continues to be one of the best ways to estimate the burden and trend of COVID-19 in Ottawa. Despite the slight increase in weekly positivity last week, our cumulative positivity has been fairly stable at around eight percent.

Governor Whitmer Reopens Auto Dealerships and Retail Businesses by Appointment, Authorizes Nonessential Medical, Dental and Veterinary Procedures
Governor’s order allows gatherings of ten people or less, with social distancing
Thursday, May 21, 2020, Governor Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-96, re-opening retail businesses and auto dealerships for by-appointment shopping, starting on May 26. Retailers must limit shopping to 10 customers at a time. Starting immediately, the order also allows for small gatherings of 10 people or less, as long as they practice social distancing. The governor's office added the order will lift the requirement that health care providers delay some non-essential medical, dental and veterinary procedures, starting on May 29.
Businesses that the governor has authorized to reopen must provide COVID-19 training to workers that covers, at a minimum, workplace infection-control practices, the proper use of PPE, steps workers must take to notify the business or operation of any symptoms of COVID-19 or a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and how to report unsafe working conditions.

Governor Whitmer Takes Action to Continue Protecting Michigan Families, Workers from the Spread of COVID-19 

Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-100 to extend Michigan’s Safer at Home order until June 12, 2020. The governor’s order also protects Michiganders from the spread of COVID-19 by extending the temporary closure of certain places of public accommodation such as theaters, gyms and casinos. 
The extended orders cover protections for workers who stay home and stay safe when they or their close contacts are sick, restoring water service to those whose water has been shut off, the affirmation of non-discrimination policies in the provision of COVID-19 care, and more.
The governor also signed Executive Order 2020-99 to extend the state of emergency declaration related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The governor’s aggressive measures are working, but there is still more to be done. For instance, cases in some counties in Western and Mid-Michigan are now doubling approximately every 10 days. To continue to protect Michigan families from both the public health and economic impacts of the virus, and to lower the chance of a second wave, the governor’s emergency declaration is extended until June 19, 2020.

Dogs
Beach etiquette

If you're planning a visit to an Ottawa County Parks & Recreation beach this summer, please review the information in full. 
Beach Etiquette
Beaches are smaller this year than they have been in the last two decades. Prepare yourself for less room on the beach to spread out in the sand. With COVID being a concern in our community, smaller beaches have the potential to become more problematic. In addition to normal beach etiquette (e.g. no smoking, no loud music, no kicking or throwing sand at other beach goers), we have put together a list of things to keep in mind while visiting the beach:

Please keep six feet from other park users
Park staff cannot enforce social distancing – for serious complaints, you may contact: StayHomeStaySafeComplaints@miOttawa.org

Stay on park property (you can walk along the lakeshore, but be sure to set up your towel on park property, not the neighbor’s property – there are signs marking the end of park property on the beach)
Keep off the dune, do not make new trails or spots to lay your towel in the dune grass
Do not dig in to the sand cliff, falling sand can be extremely dangerous

This national time of observation raises awareness of mental health needs, reduces stigma about mental illness, and educates people on mental health resources in their community. In the United States one in five people will experience a mental illness during their lifetime and almost everyone will face challenges in life that can impact their mental health. The good news is there are many resources available to improve mental health and increase resiliency - and there are ways you can be supportive of friends, family, and co-workers who are struggling with life's challenges or their mental health.

EGLE provides guidance on flushing plumbing at businesses and facilities prior to restarting operations
The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) is reminding property managers throughout the state to be prepared to properly flush the plumbing of facilities that have been temporarily closed in response to the state’s efforts to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Statewide efforts to slow the spread of the virus have resulted in the closure or limited use of many buildings, such as restaurants and other businesses. This can lead to low or no use of water in these facilities. Water that sits unmoving in building plumbing for extended periods is at increased risk for leaching of metals (such as lead), reduced effectiveness of water treatment chemicals and bacterial growth.

Residents at Christian Haven Home in Grand Haven test positive for COVID-19
Christian Haven Home assisted living, like so many other long-term care facilities across the country, has felt the effects of COVID-19.

Older adults and risk of COVID-19 infection
People in Senior Living Facilities and those living in congregate settings are at a higher risk of person-to-person contact and infection. According to the CDC, older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
To protect these vulnerable friends and family members, the CDC has advised that long-term care facilities restrict visitors, regularly check healthcare workers and residents for fevers and symptoms, and limit activities within the facility to keep residents safe. The Ottawa County Department of Public Health has been working with facilities in the county to provide guidance on disease prevention, identify positive cases among staff and residents and isolate those individuals to contain the spread of the virus.
Even with many protocols in place, we are seeing the majority of Ottawa County deaths happen to people aged 70 years and older.

People with loved ones in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other types of senior living facilities may be understandably concerned about their loved one’s risk of illness from COVID-19. The effects this pandemic has had on the senior community is a reminder of how we need to work to protect others and keep this virus from spreading.
Disease Prevention Reminders

Wash your hands often with soap and water.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth cover when around others.
Keep at least 6 feet distance from people not in your household.
Cover coughs and sneezes.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

Governor Whitmer Reopens Retail, Restaurants, and Offices in Upper Peninsula, Traverse City Regions  

Businesses that reopen must adopt workplace safety measures to protect employees, customers 
Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-92, allowing for the reopening, in two regions, of retail businesses, office work that cannot be done remotely, and restaurants and bars with limited seating. The two regions are both in the northern part of the state—specifically, MERC regions 6 and 8, as detailed in the governor’s MI Safe Start Plan to re-engage Michigan’s economy. 
The governor also signed executive order 2020-91 to ensure robust protections for Michigan workers as she continues to re-engage parts of the economy. This executive order requires all businesses to adhere to strict safety guidelines to protect their workers, their patrons, and their communities from infection. To foster compliance, the governor also signed Executive Directive 2020-6 to appoint a Director of COVID-19 Workplace Safety within the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity (LEO).

MDHHS Issues Emergency Order ReinforcingExecutive Orders 2020-69, 2020-71, 2020-91 and 2020-92

Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Director Robert Gordon issued an Emergency Order Monday, May 18, finding that the procedures and restrictions in Executive Orders 2020-69, 2020-71, 2020-91 and 2020-92 are needed to control the COVID-19 epidemic, reinforcing the governor’s orders and allowing for civil fines of up to $1,000 and referral to licensing agencies for violations. This new order rescinds an April 2 order that made the same finding with respect to earlier versions of the governor’s orders.  

“More than 51,000 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in our state, and appropriate social distancing is the primary tool available to slow the spread of the virus and save lives,” Gordon said. “The real heroes of this crisis are the medical workers, first responders and other essential workers who are putting their lives on the line for us every day. We owe it to them to do what we can ourselves to stop the spread of the virus. The Executive Orders issued by the Governor are intended to protect the health and safety of all Michiganders. A civil penalty and potential licensing actions send a strong message to Michiganders that we are serious about enforcing these orders.”

**The Facebook LIVE briefings at 4:30 pm and update bulletins are moving to only two (2) days per week starting this week - Tuesdays and Fridays**

Unfortunately, we have to report three additional deaths. A female in her late 70s, female in her 60s and a male in his late 60s, all with underlying health conditions. Our thoughts go out to their family and friends during this difficult time.

Why have Ottawa County's positive cases increased so much lately?
The increased availability of testing contributes to the number of positive cases increasing over the last several weeks. This is an indicator of progress being made in identifying infections to better slow the spread but it is also evidence the virus is still circulating in our community. To help aid in disease investigation, please be sure to answer your phone and return any calls from the Ottawa County Department of Public Health. We have a team of specialists diligently conducting contact tracing and continuing to work on containing the virus.
It is encouraging to see the hospitalization rate go down and the number of recovered cases increase. However, it is still imperative people continue to keep physical distance and wear a face cover in public and frequently wash hands and disinfect surfaces to make even more progress. As more and more businesses open, there is a greater risk of person-to-person infection of the virus and our actions make a difference whether we slow or increase the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

MediLodge At The Shore News Release
MediLodge At The Shore has been working with the Ottawa County Department of Public Health on disease investigation. As of Friday, May 15, 2020, the long-term nursing facility has 22 COVID-19 positive residents. READ MORE

We added more information to our website's Michigan COVID-19 Business Response Center. This includes Health Practices from the Michigan Economic Recovery Council to guide various sectors as they are phasing into reopening. Additionally, below are resources on how local public health works with businesses on prevention and what to do if a positive case is at the workplace.

GVSU students donate appliances to Ottawa County to help those impacted by COVID-19
Story by: Meagan Saxton in University Communications 
Microwaves and refrigerators that once belonged to students who lived in Grand Valley housing were donated to the Ottawa County Department of Public Health to help vulnerable populations impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The county received more than 20 appliances during an organized pickup held shortly after May 10, the last day students returned to campus to retrieve their personal belongings.
Rence Meredith, Facilities Services maintenance supervisor, said department of public health officials approached GVSU and asked about appliances students bring with them to campus. Those appliances are occasionally left behind, Meredith said. A coordinated effort among Facilities Services, the Grand Valley Police Department, and Housing and Residence Life garnered 15 microwaves and six refrigerators to donate. Colleen Bailey, associate director of Housing and Residence Life, said a message was sent to students who still had items to retrieve, and within a few hours, donations came in.

“We ask for something and our students are willing to contribute,” Bailey said. “They have limited resources, but that’s just the Grand Valley way.”

Maintenance staff members relocated the donations from the various living centers across campus to one central location for pick-up. Jennifer Sorek, Ottawa County public health preparedness coordinator, said the department is appreciative of the generosity and support of GVSU students. She said the county has been working with community partners to ensure safe and comfortable isolation and quarantine conditions for vulnerable populations.

“The microwaves and refrigerators will be placed in temporary housing locations for individuals who are impacted by COVID-19, but cannot return home or may be homeless,” Sorek said.

MDHHS Statement on COVID-19 Case Reporting

The COVID-19 case count reported May 14, 2020 showed a significant increase over reports from previous days. Several factors are contributing to this increase including backlogged results being reported electronically into the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS) and increased testing at correctional facilities across the state. 
The report of 1,191 cases included cases from commercial labs Garcia, a lab with significant presence in Michigan’s correctional facilities and corporate environment, Orchard Technology and P4. Results from these labs were being entered manually, which led to a backlog, and are now being reported electronically into MDSS. 
This backlog in reporting did not result in delays of notification to individuals with positive results as those results were transmitted separately to health care providers who are responsible for notifying individuals about their test results.

Michigan Financial Institutions Urged to Protect Customers’ COVID-19 Economic Impact Payments 
Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS) issued a bulletin strongly encouraging financial institutions to protect customers’ COVID-19 economic impact payments from overdrafts and fees.

“Michiganders have been greatly impacted by COVID-19, and we must do all we can to help those who are suffering financial losses due to this pandemic,” said Gov. Whitmer. “Our state’s financial institutions have been good partners in their communities, and we encourage them to continue to assist their customers with the financial challenges they face.”

Relief funds, distributed by the federal government as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, are intended for necessities, such as food, medicine, and housing during this public health emergency and disaster. Guidance issued in today’s bulletin encourages Michigan financial institutions to treat those deposits in the spirit of the disaster relief legislation so Michiganders can use the funds on those important living expenses. Institutions are strongly urged not to access customers’ COVID-19 stimulus payments to satisfy overdrafts or for overdraft fees, ATM fees or late payment fees.

Testing - Treatments - Vaccines - Fraud
As the country progresses through the COVID-19 response, there have been many developments and misinformation about testing, therapeutics and vaccines. We want to provide you with credible information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who has been working with other federal, state and local agencies and public health officials across the country. This continued critical work is to protect public health. Major focus areas of the FDA’s response include increasing the availability of testing, therapeutics and devices such as ventilators and personal protective equipment, and many other important items necessary for the response. 
Some Highlights of Recent FDA Activities:
(Click for the full summary.)


Ensuring Timely Availability of Accurate and Reliable Tests

Worked with more than 385 test developers who have said they will be submitting Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for tests that detect the virus. FAQs

Among the individual EUAs are 12 serology (antibody) tests that have been authorized to date. FAQs




Accelerating Availability of Medical Equipment and Products for Treatment

Authorized EUAs and issued policies to help increase the availability of personal protective equipment, such as respirators, gowns, surgical masks and more.

Monitoring nearly 80 COVID-19 drug development programs that are in progress, with multiple candidates under investigation that may be able to effectively treat patients before a vaccine is developed.





Actively Monitoring the Medical Product and Food Supply Chains to Address Imbalances

Continue to screen and monitor millions of domestic and international products in the medical supply chain.

Worked with federal partners to ensure the delivery of 3.1 million cloth face coverings to over 1,000 grocery store chains and small grocery stores for employee use.




Halting Individuals or Companies Selling Products with Fraudulent Claims

Issued hundreds of abuse complaints resulting in the marketplaces removing listings for 260 products that claimed to diagnose, treat or even cure COVID-19.

Issued 42 health fraud warning letters to sellers of unapproved products with bogus COVID-19 claims, including homeopathic drug products, cannabidiol products, nasal sprays, colloidal silver products, herbalproducts, chlorine dioxide products and others.

Events - Gatherings - Crowds
Our community has been working so hard and contributing so much to slow the spread of COVID-19. We understand many people are eager to go places and gather with friends and family members, but we must stay focused on disease prevention methods to minimize the risk of further infection and ensure the health system capacity is not overburdened. By keeping with physical distancing and wearing a face cover in public, along with frequent hand washing and disinfecting, we can continue to make progress and work to avoid a second wave of infection. Our actions make a difference whether we slow or increase the spread of COVID-19 in our community.
We know that the virus spreads person-to-person between people who are in close contact with one another through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Public gatherings increase the likelihood of infection. Even if you don’t have symptoms, you could still be a carrier of the virus. Please protect others, especially those who are at a higher risk of severe complications from the disease; such as the elderly, those with underlying health conditions, those who have limited access to resources and care, and many others.

Parks Updates
Since the initial Stay Home, Stay Safe Executive Order issued on March 23, there have been additional guidelines that that have affected park operations. Executive Order 2020-77 amended the scope of the original shelter-in-place order and extended the duration to May 28, 2020. This order identified parks and park employees as essential (more detail below).

The Ottawa County Parks & Recreation Commission has been working hard to keep parks open and safe. At this time, all park properties remain open, but some amenities such as playgrounds, rental facilities, restrooms, dog parks and beaches, and our Nature Center are closed. At some parks, one-way trails were implemented to help with social distancing and parking has been limited to avoid overcrowding.

New research and information about COVID becomes available every day and in light of updated guidelines from the CDC related to pets, the Grand Ravines Dog Park and the off-leash dog beach at Kirk Park have been temporarily closed. Both will re-open when these recommendations are lifted. The decision to close these amenities is in-line with the majority of the park systems state-wide. Please note: The CDC does not suggest that pets are a threat to their owners or other park visitors, but rather that there is a strain that can affect pets. This is an important distinction.
Both park properties remain open to the public. Dogs are still welcome on-leash at Grand Ravines outside of the dog park area. With the Kirk Park dog beach being closed, its rules will temporarily fall in line with Ottawa County’s other Lake Michigan parks, where dogs are not allowed from May 1-September 30. It is possible that Kirk Park will open to dogs sooner than September 30. Please note with continued beach erosion, there will likely be some restrictions in place after re-opening. Ottawa County Parks has many dog-friendly parks and open spaces, please visit our website for more information.

Since the last update on Friday, May 8, Ottawa County has had an additional death - a male in his 80s with underlying health conditions. Our thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.

Michigan is in Phase 3 and Pressing on to Phase 4


Governor Whitmer released the Six Phases of the MI Safe Start Plan to re-engage Michigan’s economy. The Governor has worked with leaders in public health, health care, business, labor and education to develop the plan. Re-engagement will happen in phases. Those businesses that are necessary to protect and sustain life are already open. As we move into lower-risk phases, additional business categories will reopen and the restrictions on public gatherings and social interactions will ease.


Governor Whitmer announced that we’ve made progress in the first two phases – Uncontrolled Growth and Persistent Spread.


Governor Whitmer indicated that Michigan is in phase three, Flattening, where the state’s daily new cases and deaths remain relatively constant over some time and the health system capacity is sufficient for current needs. Specified lower-risk businesses are beginning to reopen given adherence to strict safety measures.  


Public Health will be guided by the facts in deciding whether to transition from one phase to another. State and local officials are looking at data every day to understand if the epidemic continues to spread and whether hospitals and other health care providers can safely cope with any surge in infections and the public health system can suppress new outbreaks.


Michigan must reopen gradually and safely. Recently, outdoor work, construction and real estate opened and today Michigan’s manufacturing workers returned to work. By proceeding incrementally, we can evaluate the effects of our decisions. If cases start to surge, we may need to tighten up again. If the disease is contained, we can keep relaxing, moving into the later phases of Improving, Containing and Post-pandemic. The MI Safe Start Plan will re-engage our economy carefully and deliberately to avoid the second wave of infections.


Re-engaging the economy will be a long process. Our ability to move forward depends on all of us. Please keep practicing disease prevention measures by maintaining physical distance between you and others (at least six feet), frequently washing hands and surfaces, wearing a face covering in public and staying home as much as possible, especially if you’re not feeling well.READ MORE

How a Michigan county is saving hundreds of hours of work while tracking high-risk COVID-19 contacts
The first person to test positive for COVID-19 in Ottawa County, Michigan, was in close contact with about 70 other people during the time they might have been infected. It fell to the local county health department to contact those 70 people and monitor their symptoms to ensure they didn’t become infected with the fast-spreading virus. But Spencer Ballard, Environmental Health Supervisor at the department, realized that task would soon become impossible. The department nurses would need to call each person who came into contact with an infected individual every day for up to 14 days, or more in some situations, and each call would take about 10 minutes.

Ottawa County—Michigan’s eighth largest—boasts a rapidly-growing population of nearly 300,000. Ballard knew the number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 would grow exponentially, and the nurses charged with calling high-risk contacts still had their normal jobs to do.
So the department got to work putting together a solution on the Qualtrics XM platform they then linked with their own case management system. Instead of calling each person every day, the department nurses approach each close contact of a COVID-19 case and explain that they will receive a text or email from the health department every day for 14 days.

What You Need to Know About Pets & COVID-19
With recent news of tigers, lions and pet cats in the US testing positive for the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), you may be wondering about the risks to your pets. We’re still learning about this virus and how it might affect animals, including pets, but there are simple ways to protect your pet from possible infection. It’s important to know how to protect both people and pets during this pandemic.
Treat pets like your other human family members to protect them from a possible infection.

Don’t let your pets interact with people or other animals outside your household.
Keep cats indoors as much as possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.
Walk your dog, but always on a leash at least 6 feet from other people and animals.
Don’t go to dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.

Thank you, Michael Gethin and M.W. WATERMARK employees, for making and donating 110 cloth face coverings to the Community Action House. The company is also using lasers to cut medical fabric for others to sew, as part of the volunteer network Michigan Face Mask Warriors.
Why do you need to wear a face cloth covering?
In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting. This is to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms..
When do you need to wear a face cloth covering?
A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people are in a community setting, especially in situations where you may be near people. These settings include grocery stores and pharmacies. These face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, rather another tool to prevent the spread of the virus. Continue to maintain at least 6 feet apart from others and frequently wash hands and surfaces.

Governor Announces Michigan is in Phase Three 
After announcing that Michigan’s manufacturing workers will return to work on Monday, May 11, Governor Gretchen Whitmer detailed the six phases of her MI Safe Start Plan to re-engage Michigan’s economy. The governor has worked with leaders in health care, business, labor, and education to develop the plan, and announced today that Michigan is in phase three. 
The phases of the pandemic include:
1) UNCONTROLLED GROWTH: The increasing number of new cases every day, overwhelming our health systems. 
2) PERSISTENT SPREAD: We continue to see high case levels with concern about health system capacity. 
3) FLATTENING: The epidemic is no longer increasing and the health-system's capacity is sufficient for current needs. 
4) IMPROVING: Cases, hospitalizations and deaths are clearly declining. 
5) CONTAINING: Continued case and death rate improvements, with outbreaks quickly contained. 
6) POST-PANDEMIC: Community spread not expected to return.

Michigan’s Big 3 Auto Manufacturers Can Return to Work on May 11
Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-77 to extend Michigan’s Stay Home, Stay Safe order to May 28. The Governor’s order will allow manufacturing workers, including those at Michigan’s Big 3 auto companies, to resume work on Monday, May 11 as part of her MI Safe Start Plan.  
Under Executive Order 2020-77, manufacturing facilities must adopt measures to protect their workers from the spread of COVID-19. That includes conducting a daily entry screening protocol for workers and everyone else entering the facility, including a questionnaire covering symptoms and exposure to people with possible COVID-19, together with a temperature screening as soon as no-touch thermometers can be obtained. They must also create dedicated entry points at every facility, and suspend entry of all non-essential in-person visits, including tours.

We are saddened to report a female in her 60s, a male in his 80s--both who had underlying health conditions--and a female in her 20s with no known underlying health conditions passed away since our last update. Our thoughts go out to their families and friends during this difficult time of mourning their loss. 

Click on the dashboard to expand. Data Source: Michigan Disease Surveillance System.
Be sure to check out the various tabs in the new dashboard. You can view total case counts, which include laboratory-confirmed cases and probable cases, or view each case type individually. Probable cases are those who have not had a test but have symptoms and have been in contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19. Additionally, age, sex, race, ethnicity and location demographics are available. You can also view testing information by clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the dashboard. We hope you find the information useful as we continue surveillance and identifying cases to slow the spread of the virus in our community. 

Prevention Measures are Still Relevant and Crucial
Your actions make a difference in slowing or increasing the spread of COVID-19.
As the weather gets warmer and people are venturing outside, along with businesses starting to phase into reopening and holiday celebration plans being developed, please keep in mind we are NOT in a position to relax the disease control measures our community has been working so hard on and contributing so much.  
By keeping with physical distancing and wearing a face cover in public, along with frequent hand washing and disinfecting, we've been able to slow the spread in Ottawa County. Now is not the time to let up or loosen these actions. We understand many people are eager to open up all businesses and gather with friends and family members, but we must maintain the community mitigation strategies put in place to avoid a second wave or surge of COVID-19 in our community. 
People who do not have COVID-19-like symptoms could still be carriers of the virus. Please protect others, especially those who are at a higher risk of severe complications from the disease; elderly, those with underlying health conditions, those who have limited access to resources and care, and many others as we're learning more about the disease. 
Please do the following and encourage others to do the same:

Avoid close contact - Put distance between yourself and other people.
Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others.
Wash your hands often with soap and water and avoid touching your face.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

State Provides Best Practice Guidelines to Help Protect Workers as Construction Industry Reopens

Employers urged to take necessary precautions to reduce the spread of COVID-19
As the construction industry reopens tomorrow, May 7, the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity highlighted requirements for employers and provided further guidance on best practices to help protect Michigan workers and reduce the spread of COVID-19.

“We must take aggressive action to reduce COVID-19 exposure in order to prevent a second spike in cases,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said. “The only way we can safely reopen businesses, including our job providers in the construction industry, is to be smart about protecting our workforce. We’re ensuring employers understand how to protect their employees and customers, and we continue to save lives.”

The governor’s Executive Order 2020-70, allows the May 7 resumption of some types of work that present a very low risk of infection, including construction. LEO, in collaboration with leaders and experts from industry, and state and local public health, has developed best practice guidelines that help construction industry employers understand the requirements under the order. The best practice guidelines can be found on LEO’s website.

Funds will help aging residents during COVID-19 pandemic
Michigan will help its aging adults stay healthy and live independently with nearly $25.3 million received from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Among other things, the CARES Act provides supplemental funding for programs authorized by the Older Americans Act of 1965. Michigan will spend its money supporting residents aged 60 and over served by Older Americans Act programs. These programs provide a wide range of services, such as help with bathing and dressing, rides to doctors’ offices, education on managing chronic illnesses, support for family caregivers, and much more.
Provided by a network of community-based organizations – such as Area Agencies on Aging, local community and senior centers, faith-based organizations, Commissions and Councils on Aging, and other nonprofit service providers – these programs help millions of older adults stay healthy and continue living independently.

MDARD Advises Businesses, Consumers on the Sale and Use of Disinfectants

Selling, distributing unregistered disinfectants poses public safety risk
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) is reminding businesses and consumers how to buy and use disinfectants safely, effectively and legally. Disinfecting is an important step in preventing and reducing the spread of viruses, bacteria, and other microbes, including SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.   
Disinfectants are considered pesticides by law and are regulated by MDARD and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA has compiled a list of products that can be used against COVID-19. The list is periodically updated with new information.  

“It is illegal to make, sell, or give away an unregistered disinfectant and doing so puts the public’s health at risk,” said Mike Philip, Pesticide and Plant Pest Management Division Director. “Making your own disinfectant by repackaging a product, or creating your own recipe and selling it, or giving it away is both dangerous and a violation of state and federal law. It also puts public health at risk when the law isn’t followed. In the case of pesticides and disinfectants, the label is the law.”

AG Nessel Confirms Executive Orders Enforceable
Attorney General Sends Guidance to Local Authorities
The Michigan Legislature’s failure to pass an extension of the state of emergency and disaster declared by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer caused confusion and frustration among law enforcement officials throughout the state.  
Many of those law enforcement officials – along with members of the public – contacted the Department of Attorney General asking whether the Governor’s Stay Home, Stay Safe Order (2020-70) and places of public accommodation order (2020-69) are still enforceable.    
After reviewing the issue, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a letter of guidance today to local law enforcement officials across the state. In her letter, Nessel finds the two orders to be valid under the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act and asks local law enforcement agencies to continue their enforcement efforts.

AG Nessel Warns of Websites Selling Coronavirus-related Products that Never Arrive
Attorney General Dana Nessel issued an urgent consumer alert today to notify Michiganders of another online retailer that is taking advantage of consumers looking to buy products like hand sanitizer and face masks during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.  
Nessel’s office recently received a complaint from a concerned Michigan consumer about a website called OkHomeOnline selling face masks, alcohol-based cleaning wipes, hand sanitizer, toilet paper and other products in high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.   
The consumer reported being charged for a purchase, but never received the order. Later attempts to check the order status were unsuccessful when the website could no longer be accessed.   
The Attorney General’s office found that multiple complaints were available online with consumers going through the exact same situation as the Michigan resident. They placed the order only to find that the website disappeared. Furthermore, the phone numbers and addresses listed for the “company” appear to be stolen from other businesses that do not make or sell coronavirus-related products.

Loneliness and Social Isolation Linked to Serious Health Conditions
As we are still working through the Stay Home – Stay Safe period, loneliness and social isolation in older adults are serious public health risks. This can affect a significant number of people in the United States and put them at risk for dementia and other serious medical conditions such as premature death, heart disease, stroke, anxiety and depression. A new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine points out that more than one-third of adults aged 45 and older feel lonely, and nearly one-fourth of adults aged 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated. Older adults are at increased risk for loneliness and social isolation because they are more likely to face factors such as living alone, the loss of family or friends, chronic illness and hearing loss.

Loneliness is the feeling of being alone, regardless of the amount of social contact. Social isolation is a lack of social connections. Social isolation can lead to loneliness in some people, while others can feel lonely without being socially isolated.

Additionally, the report highlights that immigrant and LGBT populations experience loneliness more often than other groups. Latino immigrants, for example, “have fewer social ties and lower levels of social integration than US-born Latinos.” First-generation immigrants experience stressors that can increase their social isolation, such as language barriers, differences in the community, family dynamics, and new relationships that lack depth or history, the report states. Similarly, gay, lesbian and bisexual populations tend to have more loneliness than their heterosexual peers because of stigma, discrimination and barriers to care.

If you know of someone experiencing loneliness during this time of physical distancing, be sure to call, text, video chat, email or mail a card to let them know you’re thinking about them. If you or someone is in need of assistance, please call 2-1-1.

STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS CONTINUE LIFE SKILL LESSONS DURING REMOTE LEARNING
Home Depot and Lowe’s donate supplies needed for instruction.
With school buildings closed for the remainder of the school year, students ages 18-26 with special needs in the Young Adults Services (YAS) program continue to learn work and life skills at home that will allow them to enter adult life as independently as possible, with help from dedicated instructors thinking outside the box.
Thirty students in the YAS program, a service of Ottawa Area Intermediate School District, are completing woodworking projects at home that continue to build skills typically learned in the classroom. While working on the projects, students are following verbal and written directions, learning to use tools, and interacting with their teacher and the community. The lasting benefit of these skills including growing verbal and written skills, a sense of independence, building fine and gross motor skills, and interacting with the public through sales of their products.
Student-built pieces include inspirational signs and birdhouse kits created by the instructors and bird feeder kits donated by Home Depot and Lowe’s, both of which also donated building tools and supplies to help complete the kits. Instructors currently have enough inventory to give each student one project a week until the end of the school year.

Guidelines on Non-essential Procedures IncludeNot Delaying Important Medical Care 

Current restrictions on non-essential medical and dental procedures were put into place in late March to ensure healthcare systems had enough staffing, bed capacity and personal protective equipment (PPE) to care for all patients, as well as to limit the spread of COVID-19. Further guidelines were recently shared with providers to address questions about how patients can be served safely during this time.  
Executive Order 2020-17 was meant to be flexible so patient care can be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine which services are needed more immediately and which can be safely delayed without resulting in a decline in health. 
It is also important for patients to understand they should not delay important medical care, especially emergency care. If there are signs of potentially life-threatening disease, such as a heart attack or stroke, do not delay testing or treatment.

Observance of Mental Health Month Has Added Significance During COVID-19 Crisis

Resources available at Stay Home, Stay Well website
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) stands with mental health advocates and organizations in recognizing May as Mental Health Month. Observed nationally since 1949 and traditionally symbolized by a green ribbon, the mental health awareness effort sets a goal to combat stigma and provide support and education on matters pertaining to mental illness. It also aims to draw attention to suicide, which can be brought on by mental illness, in the hopes of further development of suicide prevention strategies.  
During the COVID-19 crisis, mental health is increasingly becoming a focus of attention. In response, information about available mental health resources can be found through the state’s Stay Home, Stay Well initiative. These efforts are to help build resilience in Michigan residents trying to cope emotionally with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and include links to crisis help lines, guidance documents, videos and other mental health resources at Michigan.gov/StayWell.

Ottawa County's COVID-19 Response Updates - Fri-Sun, May 1-3, 2020
Ottawa County, Michigan sent this bulletin at 05/12/2020 03:56 PM EDT






















Ottawa County I Fri-Sun, May 1-3
Latest Video Updates I Previous BulletinsMedia Contact: Kristina Wieghmink, OCDPH public information officerkwieghmink@miottawa.org I mobile/text 616-510-8523

NEW: DATA DASHBOARD 2.0 RELEASED
The Ottawa County Department of Public Health released its data dashboard 2.0, new features include:


Case counts for both laboratory-confirmed and probable (people who have not had a test but have symptoms and have been in contact with a person positive for COVID-19)

Toggle ability through All, Confirmed and Probable for cases, deaths, hospitalized and recovered

Case breakdown by race (racial groups with smaller counts-less than 10 cases-will not be displayed at this time, for data reliability and privacy reasons)
Case breakdown by ethnicity
Case breakdown by 10-year age groups

Age summary (average age, median age, age range) for all cases and deceased cases
Laboratory testing data

We are saddened to report additional deaths. These are not simply numbers on a data dashboard but lives lost with loved ones mourning. Our hearts go out to their families and friends during this difficult time.
Laboratory-confirmed for COVID-19 deaths:

Female in her upper 80s
Male in his 70s
Female in her 90sAll had underlying health conditions

Probable for COVID-19 deaths

Male in his mid 60s
Female in her upper 90s
Female in her early 80s
Female in her upper 70sAll had underlying health conditions


Click on the dashboard to expand. Data Source: Michigan Disease Surveillance System.

Data tells us a story to make decisions and develop programs and services to address the social determinants of health. The COVID-19 pandemic magnifies the need for intervention in certain populations to create a more equitable society where all people have the opportunity to achieve their optimal health.
Health Disparities

With increasing testing availability, increasing case counts and further analysis, the data reveal a disparity in the proportion of COVID-19 cases among Hispanic/Latino ethnicity versus their proportion in the population. Before this point, cases were very similar to county population distribution.

Given this information, we look to see why there is a higher burden of cases among those of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. There is nothing inherently or physiologically riskier about race or ethnicity, but there are often social, economic and geographic factors that contribute to a higher vulnerability for some over others.

At this time, the data indicates that a higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino cases are working in critical infrastructure jobs than non-Hispanic/Latino cases and are therefore more at risk of being exposed to COVID-19 in symptomatic or asymptomatic people. This also increases the risk of exposure to their family members.

We’ve had significant limitations in testing for COVID-19 until about a week ago, resulting in not having an accurate picture of the impact of the virus on our community. Increases in testing may have revealed more cases that were not being detected before. A longer time frame of available testing will give more confidence about any disparity among various demographic groups. This increase may have revealed a disparity that was always there, or it may be a false artifact of recent increased availability and will smooth out as more testing continues.

What the Ottawa County Department of Public Health is doing to address the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 illness among those of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity:

Conducting frequent live Facebook briefings translated into Spanish.
Distributing frequent bulletins translated into Spanish available at miOttawa.org/mihealth and sent out through our extensive GOVDelivery listserv.
Enhancing the Ottawa County COVID-19 website to read in multiple languages, including Spanish. Many resources featured on the website are translated into Spanish or contain links to other sites such as cdc.gov/covid19 and michigan.gov/coronavirus that can be read in multiple languages.
Providing a COVID-19 resource list in Spanish.
Investigating COVID-19 cases and their contacts through multilingual and multicultural staff.
Connecting growers and migrant farmworkers with Spanish-speaking materials.
Working closely with the Ottawa County Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Office (DEI) to align our efforts on preventing inequity in the burden of COVID-19 illness. 


Letter from DEI Director Robyn Afrik



Working with Latino community leaders and faith-based organizations. 
Implementing communication strategies with Spanish radio stations, ethnic grocery stores and a Spanish podcast featuring local community members.

Learn more about the Ottawa County Community Health Improvement Plans. These plans have been developed based on local, state and national data in conjunction with numerous community agencies and members, in a continual effort to address health inequities.

Disability Network Lakeshore (DNL) recognizes that treating individuals with certain disabilities can make this process challenging and we want to be a resource. Our staff have expertise in identifying accommodations for any situation.
The examples below depict circumstances that can negatively impact effective communication and access to care for people with disabilities.

People with disabilities (PWDs), especially those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities, may not understand instructions related to things like where to go for testing, or how to proceed if they believe they have COVID-19.

Many would not have the energy to stand in the long lines needed to get testing.

PWDs are at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 for a variety of reasons - many have breathing difficulties, compromised immune systems, and/or an inability to recognize or evaluate risks, etc.

Testing sites may not be accessible to those with mobility issues. Even if they could get in, they may not be able to get to a site as many don't drive.

Fear that if the situation comes down to one ventilator between two people, the one with a disability, or the one with the most visible disability will be passed over.

Fear of being discriminated against because of advanced age and disability.

Many can't afford to pay for treatment if their insurance won't cover the full cost. There are those who have their budgets at the breaking point now and can't afford anything more.

PWDs may be uninformed of treatment options, etc. due to an inability to access, comprehend, or act on information.

Feelings of having no control often play in decisions of whether to go for treatment or not

If you or your staff encounter any of these situations or something similar, please contact DNL. Working together, we will ensure that everyone has access to care and is educated on how to stay safe and healthy!


The mission of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services (D&HHS) is to provide equal communication access, education and advocacy to the Deaf, DeafBlind and Hard of Hearing in pursuit of life’s opportunities.

In addition, during this crucial time our agency has created a place on our website, as well as our Facebook page, that focuses on getting important COVID-19 updates, that is accessible for Sign Language users, to the community. We have been working with local volunteers to provide windowed face masks for our interpreters and hope to soon start supplying these masks to the Deaf, DeafBlind, and Hard of Hearing Community.

April is Child Abuse Prevention (CAP) Awareness Month, and annually this month-long focus on prevention wraps up with the release of the National Kids Count Data. This data looks at the health, safety and well-being of children throughout the State of Michigan. A unique aspect of this data is it provides a county specific look at how children are doing in our local communities.

In Ottawa County, less children are in living in poverty since 2010 (baseline year), with the data showing a 56% decrease in children 0-17 living in poverty, and households qualifying under the federal poverty guideline and ALICE (Asset Limited Income Constrained but Employed) guideline decreasing by 15% since 2010. While families are doing better economically, the number of children who are confirmed victims of abuse and neglect has been on the rise. In Ottawa County, there has been a 160% increase in cases since 2010. Children placed in out of home placements has also been on the rise, with an increase of 69%. Child Abuse and Neglect comprise 5 out of the 10 Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), situations that cause traumatic stress for children and have long term impacts on health, economic and social wellbeing. Increasing the health of our community requires that we address this trauma and build community resilience.

What do these increases mean for our community? From the Stop Child Abuse and Neglect Council’s perspective, this points to two things 1. We as a community are doing a better job of recognizing the signs and symptoms of abuse and neglect and ensuring children get the help they need, and 2. We need to invest in prevention. Mandated reporters are critical to the health and safety of children. Ensuring everyone who works with kids can recognize the signs a family might need additional support ensures that traumatic stress is reduced, that families get the resources they need to thrive and ensures the safety of children.

Program Will Provide Tuition-Free Postsecondary Education Opportunities for Essential Workers; Governor Announces Other Initiatives to Protect Workers and Their Families During the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic 
Governor Gretchen Whitmer today announced a series of initiatives to help Michigan workers and their families during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the "Futures for Frontliners” program to provide a tuition-free pathway to college or a technical certificate to essential workers who don’t have a college degree. This includes workers like the ones staffing our hospitals and nursing homes, stocking the shelves at grocery stores, providing child care to critical infrastructure workers, manufacturing PPE, protecting public safety, picking up trash, or delivering supplies.

Governor Whitmer Takes Significant Step to Make Child Care Affordable and Accessible for Families 

 Governor Gretchen Whitmer today announced a $130 million investment to make child care more affordable and accessible for Michigan families during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 “Child care providers have been critical partners in helping our state respond to COVID-19, and we are extremely grateful for their service,” Governor Whitmer said. “Every child care provider and early educator is important in giving parents some peace of mind while they are delivering essential services to our state at this challenging time.” 

Michigan has created the “Child Care Relief Fund” to provide direct, non-competitive grants to child care providers. These funds help ensure:  

Child care providers currently serving essential workers remain open, and costs associated with providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic are not passed on to essential workers.
Child care providers can stay afloat during the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” state of emergency.
Child care is more affordable to families now, and as our economy begins to reopen.
Child care providers across the state have the resources needed to reopen for Michigan’s workforce when the recovery process of the current COVID-19 pandemic begins and more families are in need of child care options.

Some children are not safe, especially during the COVD-19 restrictions to Stay Home and Stay Safe
During this time of the COVD-19 restrictions to Stay Home and Stay Safe, some children are not safe. This is extremely traumatic for those children who are living in abusive homes. As we’ve been providing information and resources on mental health and domestic violence, we want to also help increase awareness of child abuse prevention. Children who are being abused, when they finally get the courage to tell, typically tell a teacher, social worker, a youth pastor or another trusted adult. These are people children don't have direct access to when they have to stay home.

"To anyone who works with child survivors of sexual or physical abuse, an order like the one we're experiencing right now is probably all of our biggest nightmares," said Darcy Fluhary, executive director of the Children's Advocacy Center of Ottawa County.

The Children’s Advocacy Center is seeing a tremendous decline in the cases of child sexual abuse being reported. Since the onset of COVID-19, referrals are down 70% from this same time last year. Unfortunately, we know child sexual abuse is continuing to happen and children are isolated more than ever.
What you can do to be proactive in preventing sexual abuse during this time.

It's Been a Rough Month
Parenting, mental health and substance use disorder resources
We are all juggling so many roles right now: parent, spouse, teacher, remote worker or maybe unemployed worker. And we are all trying to stay healthy and connected while searching for our next roll of toilet paper. Not to make light of a serious situation, but this is a lot for us to handle. Not surprisingly, alcohol sales were up 55% in March, while calls to both crisis and warm lines have also increased as our time at home has lengthened. This issue is dedicated to providing resources you can use now: mental health resources, addiction resources, parenting resources, because all of us could use a little help right now.

Outbreaks can be stressful - Local help is available
When a mental health crisis occurs, friends and family often don’t know what to do.
The behaviors of a person experiencing a crisis can be unpredictable and can change dramatically without warning. If you are worried that someone is in or near a crisis, seek help. RESOURCE BROCHURE

WARNING SIGNS OF A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS

Inability to cope with daily tasks
Rapid mood swings
Increased agitation
Out of touch with reality
Isolation from school, work, family and friends
Suicidal, homicidal or other violent thoughts or actions


What to do in a mental health crisis
Assess the situation before deciding who to call. Is the person in danger of hurting themselves, others or property? Do you need emergency assistance? Or do you have time to start with a phone call for guidance and support?

If the situation is life-threatening or if serious property damage is occurring, call 911 and ask for law enforcement assistance. When you call 911, tell them the individual is experiencing a mental health crisis and explain the nature of the emergency and your relationship to the person in crisis.
If the situation is serious but the person is not in danger of harming themselves or others, there are emergency services and advice available 24 hours a day through crisis phone lines.

There are many mental health resources available to individuals and families in Ottawa County. Check with your health insurance provider about the services for which you are eligible. If you do not have insurance or can’t afford coverage, call 2-1-1 and ask about mental health services that are available at no cost or a reduced cost in your area.
RESOURCE BROCHURE
The COVID-19 outbreak may be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Coping with stress will make you, the people you care about and your community stronger.

Lt. Governor Gilchrist & former Lt. Governor Calley encourage Michigan small businesses to apply for second round of Paycheck Protection Program funding 


Michigan businesses eligible to apply for $310 billion in additional federal funds

MIpaycheckprotection.com serves as information portal for businesses seeking support through SBA Paycheck Protection Program 

Forgivable loans will help businesses negatively impacted by COVID-19 keep employees on payroll, pay bills

The Whitmer administration along with the Small Business Association of Michigan (SBAM) and  Michigan Association of Certified Public Accountants (MICPA) announced today that businesses across Michigan are now able to apply for an additional $310 billion in Paycheck Protection Program forgivable loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration.  
Michigan small businesses (per SBA size standards) – including hospitality and food industry businesses and sole proprietorships, independent contractors and self-employed persons – are eligible to apply for loans through The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to help ensure employees continue receiving paychecks. The PPP loans were designed to provide a direct incentive for small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll and may be forgiven if all employees are kept on the payroll for eight weeks and the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utilities.

Stay Home, Stay Safe executive order extended through May 15
“Data shows that most Michiganders are doing their part by staying home and staying safe. That’s good, but we must keep it up. Social distancing is our best weapon to defeat this enemy,” said Governor Whitmer. “With new COVID-19 cases leveling off, however, we are lifting some of the restrictions put in place in the previous order. I want to be crystal clear: the overarching message today is still the same. We must all do our part by staying home and staying safe as much as possible.” 
Summary of changes

Requires people to wear homemade, non-medical grade face coverings when they enter enclosed public spaces. How to make a face covering.

Allows some workers who perform previously suspended activities to go back to work, such as landscapers, lawn-service companies and nurseries, subject to strict social distancing. 


Retailers that do not sell necessary supplies may reopen for curbside pick-up and for delivery.

Big box stores can reopen closed areas, like garden centers and paint departments.

Bike repair and maintenance can come back online.

Allows motorized boating and golf (but no golf carts), consistent with strict social distancing. 

Permits individuals to travel between their residences, though such travel during the epidemic is strongly discouraged.

Clarifies that state parks remain open, as they have been throughout the emergency.

The Ottawa County Department of Public Health strongly urges you to continue physical distancing and practicing all the disease prevention measures, such as frequent handwashing and regularly cleaning and disinfecting. These are our best defense, as we do not have any vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 at this time.
Ottawa County officials have been working diligently on developing plans and providing guidance to re-engage our society in a way that protects the health and safety of our community. This is done by using public health evidence-based strategies and consulting with professionals from the business, economic, educational and medical sectors.

Serving pregnant women and newborn babies
The Maternal Infant Health Program (MIHP) team at the Ottawa County Department of Public Health is supporting families in new and innovative ways during these unprecedented times. While business is much the same---continuing to educate on topics such as safe sleep, immunizations, breastfeeding, managing stress, accessing care, attachment and development, and much more---how our team does this is evolving daily.
Our team of nurses, social workers, and a dietician are meeting with clients over the phone and through video-conferencing. They have teamed up with community partners such as Nestlings, WIC, Community Action House, Positive Options, Holland Pediatrics, and other area businesses to strengthen supports for families. You’ll find them dropping off diapers and formula on doorsteps, or instructing parents on how to use the baby scale through windows, practicing social distancing while still assessing adequate infant growth. The MIHP team is using technology in new ways, such as creating videos of infant massage instruction and providing virtual breastfeeding counseling sessions. These methods that have been propagated because of COVID-19, but have a positive impact on how MIHP services will be delivered moving forward.

“Although most of this work would occur in the absence of coronavirus, families feel a sense of comfort that we are still here for them when most other things are not,” said program supervisor Dawn Dotson, MPA, RN


MIHP Team: Jael DelaHuerta, Marissa Lesky, Charly Nienhuis, Kyrian Kish, Becky Antaya, Cynthia Smeyers, Devon Stuit, Dawn Dotson, Molly Dewald and Sandra Lake
Becky Antaya, MIHP Registered Dietician and International Board Certified Lactation Consultant, created a formula comparison chart to inform individuals and agencies of the formula types and brands that are interchangeable, a tool which has been shared statewide and has proven highly useful as some formula types have come to be in short supply. Additionally, our Medicaid Enrollment Specialist, Devon Stuit, is assisting families with gaining insurance coverage over the phone, helping meet a need that has intensified over the past few weeks.

“Thank you so much for calling and talking with me. I appreciate that you care and check in on us, and I’m so thankful for your help,” said an Ottawa County mother who recently delivered a baby boy and is enrolled in MIHP.

The MIHP team is looking forward to reconnecting with families in-person, but in the meantime, they are committed to promoting and protecting maternal and child health for our community by whatever means required.

Ottawa County Parks & Recreation Update
The Ottawa County Parks & Recreation Commission has been working hard to keep parks open and safe. At this time, all park properties remain open, but some amenities such as playgrounds, rental facilities, restrooms, and our Nature Center are closed. At some parks, one-way trails were implemented to help with social distancing and parking has been limited to avoid overcrowding. 
New research and information about COVID becomes available every day and in light of updated guidelines from the CDC related to pets, the Grand Ravines Dog Park and the off-leash dog beach at Kirk Park have been temporarily closed. Both will re-open when these recommendations are lifted. The decision to close these amenities is in-line with the majority of the park systems state-wide.
Both park properties remain open to the public. Dogs are still welcome on-leash at Grand Ravines outside of the dog park area. With the Kirk Park dog beach being closed, its rules will temporarily fall in line with Ottawa County’s other Lake Michigan parks, where dogs are not allowed from May 1-September 30. It is possible that Kirk Park will open to dogs sooner than September 30. Please note with continued beach erosion, there will likely be some restrictions in place after re-opening.
Ottawa County Parks has many dog-friendly parks and open spaces, please visit our website for more information.

Governor's Update April 24, 2020 I WATCH I PRESENTATION SLIDES
Governor Whitmer Extends Stay Home, Stay Safe Order, Directs Michiganders to Wear Homemade Masks in Enclosed Public Spaces
Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed executive order 2020-59, extending her “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order through May 15. The new order will require people to wear homemade face coverings when they enter enclosed public spaces. It will also lift some restrictions on outdoor activities and allow some workers who perform previously suspended activities to go back to work.
The order will require people to wear homemade, non-medical grade face coverings when they enter enclosed public spaces. It will also require employers to provide at least cloth face coverings to their employees. People won’t have to wear face coverings when they’re taking a walk in the neighborhood, but when they go to the grocery store, they should be wearing one. Under the order, however, no one will be subject to criminal penalty for going without a mask.
The new executive order will also allow some workers who perform very previously suspended activities to go back on the job. Landscapers, lawn-service companies, and nurseries can return to work, subject to strict social distancing. Retailers to that do not sell necessary supplies may reopen for curbside pick-up and for delivery. Big box stores can reopen “closed areas,” like garden centers. And bike repair and maintenance can come back online.
At the same time, the order will ease up on some restrictions on members of the public. It will, for example, allow motorized boating and golf (but no golf carts), consistent with sound social distancing. It will also permit individuals to travel between their residences, though such travel during the epidemic is strongly discouraged. And it will clarify that state parks remain open, as they have been throughout the emergency.

Ottawa County's COVID-19 Response Updates - Thursday, April 23, 2020
Ottawa County, Michigan sent this bulletin at 04/23/2020 10:38 PM EDT






















Ottawa County I Thursday, April 23
Latest Video UpdateMedia Contact: Kristina Wieghmink, OCDPH public information officerkwieghmink@miottawa.org I mobile/text 616-510-8523

One additional death has been reported in Ottawa County. A female in her 90s with underlying health conditions who was a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive case. Our thoughts go out to those mourning the loss of their loved one. 

Click on the dashboard to expand. Data Source: Michigan Disease Surveillance System.
The dashboard information is updated daily by 4 pm, with COVID-19 results included as of 2 pm from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Cases confirmed after 2 pm and those reassigned to or from different jurisdictions are included in the following day's dashboard updates. The confirmed case count reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases ever reported to the Ottawa County Department of Public Health for COVID-19. Similarly, the hospitalization statistic reflects the percentage of confirmed cases who have ever been hospitalized for COVID-19 in Ottawa County. Recovered cases include those who are alive 30 days past disease onset.

Stay Healthy When Running Essential Errands
Michigan still has the Stay Home – Stay Safe executive order in effect to help slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) that includes avoiding travel, needless shopping trips and social visits. In other words, do not leave home unless you must. Below are some tips to stay healthy when running essential errands to places like grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants to pick up takeout and the doctor’s office. These tips are useful now and as we ease back into reopening businesses. 
Grocery Stores, Pharmacies, Takeout and Doctor Visits

Send only one person, and that person should wear a cloth face covering.
Avoid busy shopping hours. Often, midday on the weekends is the busiest.
Use the drive-thru windows and curbside pick-up, if available.
Keep a safe physical distance of at least 6 feet between you and other customers and employees in stores and restaurants.
Disinfect your shopping carts with a wipe.
Use touchless payment, if possible.
Sanitize your hands when you leave the store.

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds when you get home.

Clean and disinfect surfaces in your home that came into contact with your groceries or grocery bags.
Talk to your doctor about getting prescription supplies that last longer and use mail-order, if possible.
Use home delivery for groceries, prescriptions and take-out, which are the safest options, though it may not be available to everyone.

**Please note many scammers have been calling seniors, posing as United Way volunteers and taking money for shopping. If you did not call 2-1-1 or an established local agency for assistance, you are not getting help from United Way and there is a strong possibility it is a SCAM.**

Injuries and illnesses that are not COVID-19 still happen every day.
If you cannot recover at home and telemedicine isn’t an option, a trip to a doctor’s office, urgent care or the hospital is essential. If you are experiencing heart complications or other life-threatening conditions – do not delay treatment!
You should:

Call 911 if you believe it is a life-threatening emergency.
Call your doctor first, instead of going to urgent care.
If you or a member of your household have symptoms of COVID-19, call one of the screening hotlines.
Send only as many people to the doctor’s office as is necessary, wearing cloth face coverings.
Keep at least 6 feet between you and other patients.
Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds when you get home.

Antibody Testing and Diagnostic Testing
Antibody testing, also known as serology testing, checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. These antibodies are produced when someone has been sick with the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with other federal agencies to see if the tests can become more available to healthcare providers.
We do not know yet if the antibodies can protect someone from getting sick again with this virus or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone. Scientists are researching to answer those questions. Antibody tests aren’t used to determine if someone is currently sick with COVID-19 because it takes one to two weeks for someone to make antibodies in their body. This means the antibody test detects the body's immune response to the infection caused by the virus rather than detecting the virus itself. 
To know if you currently have the virus, you will need to call one of the screening phone numbers listed at miOttawa.org/miHealth. If they recommend you get tested for the virus, a healthcare provider will need to collect a sample from your nose.

Predictive Models for Pandemics
In predicting the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, many key assumptions have been based on limited data. Models can be useful tools but should not be overinterpreted, particularly for long-term projections or subtle characteristics, such as the exact date of a peak number of infections. Mathematical models can be profoundly helpful tools to make public health decisions and ensure optimal use of resources to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, but only if they are rigorously evaluated and valid and their projections are robust and reliable.
Some of the limitations of predictive models for pandemics include: 

Models change daily, often with dramatic shifts, and are best (reasonably accurate) for short term estimation.

National and state models may incorrectly estimate sub-epidemics in local areas. Ottawa County has different population characteristics (age, chronic conditions, access to care) than Oakland, all of which affect the transmission, impact and timeline of the pandemic.

Models are best for comparing the general impact of various interventions, like social (physical) distancing, rather than predicting specific numbers and dates.

When using models, always assuming the worst-case scenario can lead to inefficiencies and competition for resources while assuming the best-case scenario can lead to disastrous under-preparation.

Below is a snapshot of a model exploring the effects of social distancing (in Michigan), created by a team of scientific professionals at the University of Michigan. This takes a look at how reducing the number of close contacts on a normal day is the primary strategy or intervention to show lessening the burden of disease. This example can help guide plans and decisions as we all respond to a pandemic. EXPLORE

Health Disparities Resources
At this time in Ottawa County, the data does not indicate disproportionate numbers of cases among a specific race or ethnicity. Ottawa County has too few cases for an accurate understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our community members of various demographic groups. However, we want to keep providing information on health disparities to better understand health equity in Ottawa County.
Here are some resources from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ Public Health Administration and Office of Equity and Minority Health (OEMH) to help further our understanding of racial disparities:

Testing capacity and prioritization
While the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services may have expanded its COVID-19 testing criteria, testing may not be widely available to everyone. Healthcare providers and facilities need to ensure they have the testing supplies on hand, the personnel to do the testing (with the appropriate PPE) and lab capacity. Here is the prioritization guidance on testing:


Priority One

Hospitalized patients
Healthcare facility workers with symptoms(includes workers within a healthcare facility, not just providers of direct healthcare services)




Priority Two

Patients in long-term care facilities with symptoms (includes any resident with symptoms in congregate living arrangements, not only long-term care facilities)
Patients over age 65 years with symptoms
Patients with underlying conditions with symptoms
First responders with symptoms




Priority Three

Critical infrastructure workers with symptoms
Individuals who do not meet any of the above categories with symptoms
Asymptomatic health care workers and first responders
Individuals with mild symptoms in communities experiencing high COVID-19 hospitalizations




Priority 4

Critical infrastructure workers, including asymptomatic workers(These individuals may be tested only if specimen collection and testing capacity remains after serving all patient groups above)



If you are concerned about being tested, please call one of these screening numbers:
Holland Hospital(616) 394-2080
North Ottawa Community Health System(616) 935-7810
Spectrum Health(616) 391-2380
or visit MDHHS's COVID-19 Test Finder

Food Service License Applications remain due by April 30, as required by state law. The Environmental Health Department does not want to create additional hardships for restaurants who are already struggling because of the coronavirus mitigations strategies. Therefore, if you are a license holder who is unable to pay the license renewal fee at this time, we are waiving late fees until June 30. The application must still be submitted if you intend to renew for the 2020-2021 licensing year, but we will invoice you for the amount due and there will be no late fees as long as that amount is paid by June 30, 2020. This is in effect only for foodservice establishments located in Ottawa County. We thank those of you who have submitted the application and payment already. Please contact your inspector or our Environmental Health office if you have any questions.

Lt. Governor Gilchrist & Former Lt. Governor Calley Call for Federal Action on Additional SBA Forgivable Loans 

43,000 Michigan small businesses received more than $10 billion in first round of Paycheck Protection Program funding. 
Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II, former Lt. Governor Brian Calley and Michigan Association of CPAs President & CEO Bob Doyle, today called on federal officials to reach an agreement and authorize additional funding to the Paycheck Protection Program funds from the U.S. Small Business Administration.   
More than 43,000 businesses in Michigan impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak received more than $10 billion in forgivable loans during the first round of PPP funding. Nationally, $349 billion was authorized for the initial round of PPP, all of which was committed by April 16 – less than two weeks after the application period opened – demonstrating the continued need for small business relief.   

“While tens of thousands of Michigan businesses were able to receive more than $10 billion of relief through the Paycheck Protection Program, there continues to be a significant need for additional resources to support our small businesses,” Lt. Governor Gilchrist said. “Additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program will be critical in helping our businesses keep their doors open and in protecting the livelihoods of their workers.”

Ottawa County's COVID-19 Response Updates - Monday, April 20, 2020
Ottawa County, Michigan sent this bulletin at 04/20/2020 11:54 PM EDT






















Ottawa County I Monday, April 20

We regretfully report two additional deaths in Ottawa County
One female in her 90s and one male in his mid-80s, both had underlying health conditions. Our thoughts go out to their families and friends. Click here for a message from Heritage Senior Communities and the Ottawa County Department of Public Health about working together to contain the spread of COVID-19 among this vulnerable population of seniors. 

“We understand this pandemic has caused a great deal of disruption and angst for every one of us, whether in our senior communities or our homes,” said Lauren Gowman, Director of Operations at Heritage Property Management. “We want to assure you that we will continue to be transparent and communicative as we adapt our processes. The health and well-being of our residents and staff is our highest priority.”
“We are grateful for the close partnership we’ve had with the Heritage Senior Communities as we work through this difficult time,” said Dr. Paul Heidel, Medical Director with the Ottawa County Department of Public Health.

Testing limitations and disease investigation
Challenges with limited testing
Earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, the sparse availability of testing made it difficult to identify infection of the new coronavirus. Given this, it has made disease investigation challenging. By not having needed information about who is positive for COVID-19, disease investigation becomes limited to identify and isolate individuals to prevent further spread of the virus. This is why community mitigation strategies, such as the Stay Home - Stay Safe Executive Order were put into place. This intervention helps to lessen the chance of more infected people within Ottawa County. The mitigation also provides public health and medical professionals some time to acquire the needed resources to break the chain of infection--increased testing capacity to identify cases, personal protection equipment and eventually disease treatment and vaccines. 
To provide the public with information about the number of tests conducted, our epidemiologists and communicable disease team need to ensure the following:

Quality Assurance–To verify the Michigan Disease Surveillance System data against the data collected in Ottawa County.

Reporting Cycle–These numbers are updated mid-week which makes further breakdown into calendar weeks lagged.

Data Quality–Placing data into weekly positivity and selecting the most appropriate data to bin them (collect date, referral date, result date and other). There are different date options in different data sets, and we are working to select the best dates.

Comprehensive Data Collection–While facilities must report positive COVID-19 case counts, we may not have a complete picture of the total number of tests administered. Many commercial and hospital labs are now testing, therefore collecting the number of tests conducted is voluntary information from these institutions.

We are working at continued progress to update the data dashboard to keep the public informed. 
What testing tells us
As local health department response teams conduct COVID-19 disease investigations, each positive case can yield dozens of contacts who may have been infected. These contacts are interviewed to determine if they have developed symptoms and maybe a probable case. Most contacts of confirmed and probable cases will be asked to quarantine at home and report whether they have developed symptoms of COVID-19. Critical infrastructure personnel, such as healthcare workers or first responders, who do not have symptoms but are close contacts to confirmed or probable cases, may undergo enhanced self or employer monitoring.

It’s critically important people should continue to follow social distancing guidelines, wear a cloth face covering when in public and only leave their home for essential reasons. This will allow public health and medical professionals to minimize the number of people who get sick.

Increased testing capacity
Fortunately now, testing capacity and criteria have increased across Michigan. Armed with the tools needed to collect more data, epidemiologists and communicable disease response teams can better identify people who have the virus, trace their contacts and work to prevent further spread of infection.
Last week, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) announced the expansion of testing to all Michiganders experiencing symptoms, whereas before testing was only conducted on people who had severe symptoms, were hospitalized or those at the greatest risk of exposure. Starting April 21, MDHHS will expand the testing eligibility criteria again to include all essential workers still reporting to work in person with potential COVID-19 exposure, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. This will help identify asymptomatic cases who may still be spreading the virus as they report to work.

“This means that anyone with symptoms can get a test as well as any individual regularly interacting with others outside their household, as long as the testing location has the supplies,” Khaldun said. “MDHHS is also working with local health departments to expand testing in group living facilities with potential exposure.”

Where to find testing
If you are concerned about being tested, please call one of these screening numbers:
Holland Hospital(616) 394-2080
North Ottawa Community Health System(616) 935-7810
Spectrum Health(616) 391-2380

Homemade cloth face coverings
Health care facilities and nonprofits are accepting homemade masks, gowns and other medical supplies for frontline workers, clients and patients. While handmade masks are not a replacement for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), the CDC has begun to recommend that the individuals wear such mask when out in public.
If you are interested in sewing handmade masks, please sign up to be a volunteer on the Find the Helpers website and visit the Facebook Group West Michigan COVID-19 Open Source Medical Supplies to join a community of local sewers. Once you are connected through these groups, you will be given further directions on requests for masks and where to supply them.

Local business responds by making and donating masks
As soon as it became clear the world was changing so quickly, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I had a number of MW Watermark employees contact me, asking if we could make masks for local hospitals and our local community. Our “why” has always revolved around “making a difference”, so taking on a project like this was a natural fit. We were already set up to manufacture filter press cloths with two large lasers for cutting and a skilled team of industrial sewers to finish them. Amazingly, we were producing masks using the Holland Hospital’s pattern provided on their website within one day! We have remained open as an essential business with a reduced workforce and will continue to make masks as long as there is a demand for them.
Together We Can Make A Difference!

NEW: 12 out of 91 Ottawa County cases have recovered.
The state has recently defined recovered as people with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who are alive 30 days post-onset (after they started having symptoms).
At this time, the Ottawa County data in the dashboard are for laboratory-confirmed cases only. As the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) begins providing probable case information, many other local health departments--including Ottawa County--will display laboratory-confirmed and probable case data separately in the dashboard. Case counts may differ from those reported by MDHHS if cases get reassigned to or from different jurisdictions. More information about reporting probable cases here.

Helping Older Adults During Social Distancing
The elderly are more vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. Many people are keeping their distance from their older relatives, friends and neighbors to keep them safe. Help minimize the loneliness that social distancing can cause with these tips:

Call older adults -- family members, friends and retired neighbors-- and make sure they are doing well. A friendly voice can help reduce anxieties during this time.

Grocery shop for them, arrange and deliver a curbside grocery service, or assist in arranging a grocery delivery service.

Assist them in accessing telehealth for an urgent healthcare need. Assist in getting prescriptions and medications for them.

Provide older adults with guidance on using a new cell phone feature. This could be text messaging, video chats, social media, emails, the internet and photo sharing. Share links to videos, music, concerts, new clips, hobbies and more.Pure Michigan virtual tours here.

During the sequester, employees are isolated from the outside world - even their families – to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Personnel eat, sleep and work onsite,12 hours on and 12 hours off, never leaving the property. Why? To keep the power on for all of us.
We cannot thank these Consumers Energy employees enough for their sacrifices and hope this inspires you to stay home and stay safe. We all want to get back to normal as soon as possible. #OttawaStaysHome I Facebook.com/OttawaCounty.

We regretfully report three additional laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Our thoughts go out to the families and friends mourning their loss.
All decedents had underlying health conditions; a female in her mid-eighties, a male in his mid-nineties, and a female in her late seventies

At this time, the Ottawa County data in the dashboard are for laboratory-confirmed cases only. As the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) begins providing probable case information, many other local health departments--including Ottawa County--will display laboratory-confirmed and probable case data separately in the dashboard. Case counts may differ from those reported by MDHHS if cases get reassigned to or from different jurisdictions.
The dashboard is updated daily at miOttawa.org/miHealth.

What's the difference between the Stay Home,Stay Safe Executive Order and social distancing?
Short answer: There is no difference.
Longer explanation: The Stay Home - Stay Safe Executive Order is a directive from Governor Whitmer that creates guidelines and restrictions for Michiganders to implement social distancing. These are developed based on the advisement of public health officials and medical health experts from what is known about the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and scientific data.
Social distancing is a method to slow the spread of diseases by limiting face-to-face interactions. With COVID-19, there are no vaccines nor treatment. Social distancing--rather physical distancing--is the best defense society has at getting diseases under control. This is known as nonpharmaceutical interventions--actions taken when there are no other ways medically to address an outbreak. This is why community mitigation strategies are developed such as the Stay Home - Stay Safe Executive Order.

Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay away from others when possible, even if you have no symptoms by

Staying at least 6 feet from other people
Not gathering in groups
Staying out of crowded places and avoiding mass gatherings

LEARN MORE


When will life go back to normal?
That will depend on each of us doing our part to slow the spread of the virus. Federal and state agencies are working with experts and taking a fact-based, data-driven approach to reopening our economy in a way that protects people from the spread of COVID-19. Decisions are based on facts, science and recommendations from experts in public health, health care, business, labor and education.
One of the top factors to determine when and what restrictions can be lifted is whether the health care system can care for people who need supportive care. If people ignore the Stay Home - Stay Safe Executive Order, then it prolongs the restrictions having to be kept in place. If we are not physically distancing and implementing preventive measures, then more and more people will keep getting sick which results in an overwhelmed health care system that cannot handle the patient load.
By staying home and staying well, we are better able to break the chain of infection. This gives the health care system time and the needed support so they can keep a manageable flow of treatment for patients at the same time pharmaceutical interventions are being developed (i.e., vaccines and treatments). The last thing anybody wants is for this pandemic to reemerge and we have to go through this all over again.

Factors to determine when it's best to reopen the economy:

Sustained control of the rate of new infections and hospitalizations.
Enhanced ability to test and trace.
Sufficient health care capacity to handle resurgence.
And best practices for social distancing in the workplace.

"Phasing in sectors of our economy will be most effective when we work together as a region," said Governor Whitmer. "This doesn’t mean our economy will reopen all at once, or that every state will take the same steps at the same time. But close coordination will ensure we get this right. Over time, people will go back to work, restaurants will reopen, and things will go back to normal. We look forward to working together as one region to tackle this challenge together.”

if cases get reassigned to or from different jurisdictions. 
Data Source: Michigan Disease Surveillance System.
Dashboard is updated daily at miOttawa.org/miHealth.

Who qualifies as a COVID-19 case?

Every disease that becomes reportable to public health has a definition of who qualifies as a case. Those definitions typically include levels such as confirmed, probable or suspect.

COVID-19 is a new disease with new case definitions being developed. Up until this point, a case has been someone with an approved laboratory test that is positive for COVID-19; designating them as a confirmed case.

Other people who had exposure to, and symptoms consistent with, COVID-19 were not able to be considered a confirmed case because they did not have the laboratory test needed to define them as such.

As we learn more about this new coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently expanded the case definition to include a second category called a probable case. These are generally the people described in number 3.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services recently announced that local jurisdictions can expand testing to more people since the supply of tests and laboratories has increased.

Ottawa County may see case numbers increase
since now being able to count probable cases and the expandedability to test more people leading to more confirmed cases.
We will provide more information as it becomes available.

Help slow the spread of COVID-19
People should continue to follow social distancing guidelines, practice exceptional hygiene, wear a cloth face covering when in public and only leave their home for essential reasons. This will minimize the number of people who get sick.
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing. If you have questions about testing, please call the following screening hotlines: 


Holland Hospital at (616) 394-2080


North Ottawa Community Health System at (616) 935-7810


Spectrum Health at (616) 391-2380


Stay Home - Stay Safe . . . but what if staying home isn't safe?
Content contributed by Resilience: Advocates for Ending ViolenceA local agency supporting survivors of domestic and sexual violence
“The level of uncertainty this pandemic is creating, paired with layoffs and mandatory stay at home orders have resulted in an escalation of violence and abuse for many of the families in our community whose homes are not a safe haven,” said Beth Larsen, Executive Director of Resilience. “We are witnessing an alarming increase in the severity of cases and in the number of requests we’re receiving for emergency safe shelter. Domestic violence can escalate to lethal levels when an abuser fears a loss of control over their partner, therefore making safe assessment/referral critical.”
When safe places are limited
"Many domestic violence survivors experience their place of employment as a safe place; similarly, places of worship offer sanctuary, hope and human connection," said Holly Jasinski, Resilient Spaces Program Facilitator at Resilience. "With nearly all businesses and community gathering places temporarily closed, there simply are not places to go for respite or to reach out for help."
Since the Stay Home order was instated, Resilience has seen a 66% increase in requests for emergency shelter. This has proven to be a challenge, as emergency shelter is full nearly year-round even without a pandemic. With domestic violence cases on the rise, Resilience is working hard to find alternative safe arrangements for those fleeing violence and are ensuring services go uninterrupted.
Supporting Survivors Amid COVID-19 - LEARN MORE

Help is still available amidst state restrictions and the COVID-19 response
To enhance these potential lifelines for survivors, the Resilient Spaces training program has been helping local agencies and community leaders recognize the signs of domestic violence, implement procedures for responding safely and connect individuals and families in need of critical resources.
Learn more about how to help domestic violence survivors during the shelter in place orders, by contacting hollyj@resiliencemi.org or (616) 212-9366.  Online training and one-on-one consultations are available via Zoom.

Increased Incidents of Domestic Disputes and Domestic Violence During the Stay at Home Order
Since the Stay at Home Executive Order was issued in Michigan, the Ottawa County Sheriff Office has responded to a drastically increased number of domestic disputes and/or violence. Since the March 23, 2020 order was enacted, deputies have responded to 182 incidents of domestic disputes or arguments, these incidents did not involve an assault. However, deputies in Ottawa County were called to police 297 domestic violence cases where an assault may have taken place. The domestic dispute and domestic violence incidents in 2020 represent a 41% increase over the same period last year.

"The concern of law enforcement and many others is that offenders are in the homes for greater periods given the stay at home order," said Captain Bennett with the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office. "The current pandemic situation is undoubtedly causing stress in family situations."

The Sheriff’s Office takes domestic violence and abuse very seriously. If probable cause is present, a defendant will be charged and lodged in the Ottawa County Jail until such time the case is reviewed by the prosecutor and an arraignment is completed by the courts. We encourage all victims/survivors to report incidents of violence or abuse, and also use our great community partner services to help manage stress during these very difficult times.

Personal Protection Orders
While courthouse operations are limited, the Trial Division of the Ottawa County Circuit Court IS processing Personal Protection Orders (PPOs); including the initiation PPOs, hearings on denied PPOs and arraignments on alleged violations of PPOs. Forms for filing a PPO are available at miOttawa.org and searching PPO (or by searching “Ottawa County PPO”on Google or your preferred search engine). Please be sure to read through the entire web page. There are forms for various situations.
To make an appointment to initiate a hearing for a PPO, contact circuitcourt@miottawa.org or 616-846-8320.

What does health equity have to do with responding to COVID-19?
Public health is more than pandemics
The public health system is multi-faceted from responding to disease outbreaks to inspecting septic systems and wells, providing in-home visits for pregnant women and newborn babies, immunizing children and adults, testing for and treating sexually transmitted diseases, inspecting restaurants, providing children with hearing and vision screenings, providing dental services and so much more. All of the public health programs and services contribute to the health and wellness of our community. When we have a healthy community and optimal health can be achieved for all people, lives are saved, the quality and length of life increases, diseases are eliminated or contained, and the cost and burden on the healthcare system, public health mitigations and taxpayers' dollars are lowered.

Health equity is when all people have the opportunity to attain their full health potential and no one is disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of their social position or other socially determined circumstance.

Health disparities contribute to prolonged mitigation
The community mitigation strategies put in place by state and local health officials (Executive Order: Stay Home - Stay Safe) are designed to slow the spread of disease. If viruses, such as this new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, are not contained then restrictions are prolonged; keeping our society from functioning how it needs to economically and healthily. Amid this pandemic and pre/post-pandemic, people need to have access to healthcare and mental health services, food, safety, housing, education, employment and so much more no matter their race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual identity, disability, socioeconomic status, religion or another status.

Health equity is essential. When our community is better prepared and has the needed health resources, the better we can respond to disease outbreaks.



 
What are the needs of our community?
With the increased need for food, housing, healthcare and mental health services, utilities assistance and more during the COVID-19 response, people in Ottawa County have pulled together even more to address these needs. The systems and programs put in place by public health, mental health, healthcare systems, businesses and  community foundations, organizations and members over the years have all contributed to preparing our community and aiding in its response. Before COVID-19, Ottawa County identified its needs through data collection and research collaborations:

Access to healthcare
Access and treatment for mental health
Access to healthy, local and affordable food choices and opportunities for physical activities

What can we do?
If you are in need of any health and human services, please call 2-1-1. If you want to help contribute to the needs of Ottawa County, please visit CareOttawaCounty.com for more information on how you can donate time and/or resources. The needs of any community are far too great for one person or agency to handle alone. It is through the collective efforts of all community members aiding one another during this time that will get us through the COVID-19 pandemic and any other future challenges we may face. 
Thank you to everyone who gives of their time, commitment, resources and support!

COVID-19 & Health Disparities
The COVID-19 outbreak is having an effect on marginalized and poorer communities across the globe. Often times, people with lower income, those who have jobs without paid sick time or are uninsured may not seek health care due to cost or access - leading to health disparities. Although the term disparities is often interpreted to mean racial or ethnic disparities, many dimensions of disparity exist in the United States, particularly in health. If a health outcome is seen to a greater or lesser extent between populations, there is disparity. Race or ethnicity, sex, sexual identity, age, disability, socioeconomic status and geographic location all contribute to an individual’s ability to achieve good health. It is important to recognize the impact that social determinants have on health outcomes of specific populations. People who experience health disparities and have poorer health outcomes may also have underlying medical conditions, which makes them more likely to become severely ill from COVID-19. LEARN MORE
Social Determinants of Health
Conditions in the places where people live, learn, work and play affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes. These conditions are known as social determinants of health (SDOH).
We know that poverty limits access to healthy foods and safe neighborhoods and that more education is a predictor of better health. We also know that differences in health are striking in communities with poor SDOH such as unstable housing, low income, unsafe neighborhoods or substandard education. By applying what we know about SDOH, we can not only improve individual and population health but also advance health equity. As a community, we must create social and physical environments that promote good health for all.
Know What Affects Health I HealthyPeople.gov
Health Equity
Health equity can be defined in several ways. One commonly used definition of health equity is when all people have the opportunity to attain their full health potential and no one is disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of their social position or other socially determined circumstance. 
Achieving health equity requires valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing societal efforts to address avoidable inequalities, historical and contemporary injustices, and the elimination of health and healthcare disparities.
Importance of Health Equity I Attaining Health Equity
Why is addressing social determinants of health important?
Addressing social determinants of health is a primary approach to achieving health equity. Social determinants of health such as poverty, unequal access to health care, lack of education, stigma and racism are underlying, contributing factors of health inequities.

"A large part of public health's work is achieving health equity, eliminating disparities and improving the health of all groups," said Lisa Stefanovsky, administrative health officer with the Ottawa County Department of Public Health. "In Ottawa County, we are committed to working together to assure conditions that promote and protect health for all community members."

Out of an abundance of caution, the Ottawa County Department of Public Health strongly recommends that churches do not hold drive-up services and that church members comply with the Governor's order to Stay Home and Stay Safe this Easter Sunday and while the ‘Temporary requirement to suspend activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life’ executive order is in place.
With more than 60 positive COVID-19 cases in Ottawa County, there is evidence of community-wide spread of the virus. Every precaution must be taken to protect the health of our community. We understand this will be difficult for many people. Many factors need to be considered that could create situations for personal contact such as traffic accidents, personal medical emergencies and people who may decide not to stay in their vehicles. Because we care, we ask that churches continue to find innovative technologies to serve their members. Thank you for your understanding and for helping to contain COVID-19.


These phone scams are also claiming to have COVID-19 treatments.

A volunteer at Community Action House who is helping seniors with grocery delivery, Bob Roth, shares one of his stories.
At one of my deliveries today, no one answered the door so I called the phone number on my assignment sheet. She answered and was very grateful the food had been delivered. (The sheet~~that I shred every day after the deliveries~~said she has a walker and an oxygen tank but would have her son take the food inside.) So now having my cell phone number she texted this to me hours later:

This is _____ . You delivered food to my house I wanted to express my gratitude and how beautiful it is that people care enough about us to help. I don't know if you believe but you are definitely angels in our book thank you so much may all you guys be blessed the way you have blessed us."

New Resources to Help Unemployed Workers Resolve Technical Issues with Their Accounts
To better serve Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) claimants experiencing MILogin and Michigan Web Account Manager (MiWAM) technical difficulties when applying for benefits, the Dept. of Labor and Economic Opportunity (LEO) has implemented new online tools to help users report and resolve technical issues. MILogin is the state’s single-sign-on portal to access state services, while MiWAM acts as the UIA’s system for filing your unemployment insurance claim and managing UIA accounts online. 
Claimants who previously experienced technical problems that are not yet resolved are encouraged to go back into the system to report the issues to the technical team so that the issue will be expedited for resolution. 
The fastest and easiest way to file an unemployment claim is online at Michigan.gov/UIA where the application process takes around 25 minutes. Between 90-95 percent of all claims are filed online. 
Claimants experiencing MILogin and MiWAM issues will be able to submit their online technical support request to a member of the technical team, comprised of Department of Technology, Management and Budget and UIA staff. Within a week, it’s expected that the equivalent of around 100 full-time employees will be dedicated to this effort.

Ottawa County Statistics as of April 9, 2020

Approximately, 25% of positive cases have been hospitalized. Data are are updated daily at miOttawa.org/miHealth.


Groups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:

People 65 years and older

People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility

People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:

People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People who have serious heart conditions
People who are immunocompromised

Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications


People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher)
People with diabetes
People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis
People with liver disease

Learn More - English I Spanish

Others at Risk
People with Disabilities
Disability alone may not be related to higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having severe illness. Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19. However, some people with disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection or severe illness because of their underlying medical conditions.
If you have one of the disability types listed below, you might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness. You should discuss your risk of illness with your healthcare provider.

People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members
People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing
People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness

Learn More - English I Spanish
 
People Experiencing Homelessness
Homeless services are often provided in congregate settings, which could facilitate the spread of infection. Because many people who are homeless are older adults or have underlying medical conditions, they may also be at higher risk for severe disease.
Learn More - English I Spanish
 
Pregnant Women
We do not currently know if pregnant women have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result. Based on available information, pregnant women seem to have the same risk as adults who are not pregnant.
However, we do know that

Pregnant people have changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections.
Pregnant people have had a higher risk of severe illness when infected with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza.

Governor Whitmer Extends, Expands “Stay Home, Stay Safe” Executive Order to Save Lives
Governor directs all Michiganders to stay home, stay safe through April 30 
Today, Governor Whitmer signed executive order 2020-42, extending her prior “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order through the end of April. As with the prior order, Executive Order 2020-42 limits gatherings and travel and requires all workers who are not necessary to sustain or protect life to stay home. Executive Order 2020-42 also imposes more stringent limitations on stores to reduce foot traffic, slow the spread of the coronavirus, and save lives.
Executive Order 2020-42 prohibits all businesses and operations from requiring workers to leave their homes, unless those workers are necessary to sustain or protect life or to conduct minimum basic operations. Businesses and operations are to designate the workers who meet those criteria, and must adopt social distancing practices and other mitigation measures to protect workers and patrons in the performance of that in-person work.  
Workers who are necessary to sustain or protect life include those in health care and public health, law enforcement and public safety, grocery store workers, and more. For a full list of these critical infrastructure workers, click the link to Executive Order 2020-42 at the bottom of this page. To enable these critical workers to get to their workplaces, automobile dealerships will now be allowed to open for remote sales, though showrooms must remain closed. 
Under the new order, all public and private gatherings among persons outside a single household remain temporarily prohibited. Though Michiganders may leave the house to get groceries or needed supplies, the new order encourages people to limit the number of household members running errands to the maximum extent possible. As before, people may engage in outdoor activities like walking, hiking, running, cycling, kayaking, canoeing, or any other recreational activity, consistent with remaining at least six feet from people from outside a person’s household and with other restrictions imposed by prior executive orders. The order clarifies, however, that travel for vacations or for any other purpose is prohibited. 
A new section of the order imposes restrictions on stores in an effort to reduce crowds. Large stores must limit the number of people in the store at one time to no more than 4 customers for every 1,000 square feet of customer floor space; small stores must limit capacity to 25% of the total occupancy limits (including employees) under the fire codes. To regulate entry, stores must establish lines with markings for patrons to enable them to stand at least six feet apart from one another while waiting. Large stores must also close areas of the store that are dedicated to carpeting, flooring, furniture, garden centers, plant nurseries, or paint. 
All individuals who leave their home or place of residence must adhere to social distancing measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including remaining at least six feet from people from outside the individual’s household.

Resources for sexual assault survivors continue during COVID-19
Survivors can call or text Michigan’s Sexual Assault Hotline for immediate crisis counseling, support
Counseling, advocacy and resources for survivors of sexual assault remain available during the COVID-19 crisis, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said today. Michigan’s Sexual Assault Hotline, 855-VOICES4, continues to operate and provide 24/7, free, confidential and anonymous support to survivors of sexual assault, their family, and friends.
April is National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Raising public awareness about sexual assault, and educating communities about how to prevent it, are the center of the national campaign for Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Sexual assault is broadly defined as any form of unwanted sexual contact obtained without consent. National statistics show that one in three women and one in six men experienced some form of contact sexual violence in their lifetime.

Michigan is First State to Provide Food to Families Affected by School Closings Caused by COVID-19

Families with children who received free, reduced-costlunches at school qualify for new program
Michigan has become the first state in the country to gain federal approval of a program that will provide nutritious food to children who were affected by school closings due to COVID-19. The Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer Program (P-EBT) provides temporary funding to address emergency food needs and avert financial hardship for families affected by the pandemic.  
The food assistance benefits will go to Michigan families with students ages 5-18 who are enrolled in the Michigan Department of Education program for students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals and will reach approximately 895,000 students. This includes families currently receiving Food Assistance Program benefits as well as those not currently enrolled in the program.

Ottawa County's COVID-19 Response Updates - Wednesday, April 8, 2020
Ottawa County, Michigan sent this bulletin at 04/08/2020 08:30 PM EDT






















Updates I Tuesday, April 8
Latest COVID-19 Videos - Public Health Updates I County Updates I SpanishMedia Contact: Kristina Wieghmink, OCDPH public information officerkwieghmink@miottawa.org I mobile/text 616-510-8523

Health officials have the tremendous responsibility of balancing a person’s confidentiality and providing public information. Data may be released when health officials determine there is reasonable privacy protection. The Ottawa County Department of Public Health (OCDPH) released ZIP codes with laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 cases to communicate openly with the public. However, given the relatively low positive case counts in Ottawa County, OCDPH has not released the exact number of cases per ZIP code.  
Maintaining patient privacy is challenging with connected and smaller communities, particularly with fluid social media conversations. Assumptions can be made about individuals who may have been ill, whether it was COVID-19 or not. Similarly, with other infectious disease investigations--whether it’s chickenpox, flu or chlamydia-- public health officials share limited information about a case. Collecting demographic data is used as a public health epidemiological surveillance tool for public health planning and decision-making. 

Whatever data are or are not shared by any jurisdiction does not change public health official’s mitigation strategies nor the Governor’s Stay Home-Stay Safe executive order. We appreciate everyone’s patience and working with us during these challenging times.


As of April 8, 2020, approximately 800 test results have been reported to OCDPH with 56* of those positive for COVID-19. Additional commercial testing counts are being collected, indicating the testing number could be much greater. Approximately, 23% of positive cases have been hospitalized. 

We are saddened to report there has now been one death in Ottawa County. A female in her late seventies with underlying health conditions passed away today. Our hearts go out to her family and friends during this difficult time.

Positive case demographic data in the tables below and at miOttawa.org/miHealth.*Case counts may differ from MDHHS if a case gets reassigned to another jurisdiction.

Since there is evidence of COVID-19 community spread, every location should be considered a potential risk. People of any age, even those who do not have any symptoms, could be a carrier of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. We all must do our part and Stay Home – Stay Safe – Save Lives. To slow the spread of the virus, we must adhere to social distancing and exceptional hygiene to minimize exposure and break the chain of infection.

FAQs I How to Make & Wear Face Coverings - English I Spanish
Homemade cloth face coverings are not considered personal protection equipment (PPE) since their capability to protect is unknown. These can only be effective when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning (soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub) and maintaining 6-feet physical distance among people to slow the spread of the virus. Critical PPE supplies must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and first responders and not used by the general public!

Important Message
We urge people to stay home especially if they have been drinking. We are dealing with incidents daily that involve intoxicated drivers. These incidents place Officers at risk, as well as the people who we need to have contact with because of their poor choice. Intoxicated drivers are lodged at the county correctional facility which places correctional staff and the inmate population at risk as well. All of this can be avoided by making the responsible choice to Stay Home when you have been drinking.
On another note, we are also encouraging those who are out driving to be mindful of the increased amount of pedestrian traffic because of the current situation. Students are off from school and families are outside getting some exercise which results in more pedestrians on our streets.
Please watch your speed and pay attention to crosswalksso we can all get through this safely!

Urgent Reminder from Parks & Recreation
We want residents to use and enjoy our parks and open spaces and the Stay Home order allows for this. But we ask them to use social distancing. Parks are not areas of congregation at this time. If a parking lot is half-full or more, choose a different destination. You will most likely want to avoid Rosy Mound, Grand Ravines – including the dog park, Olive Shores, and Mount Pisgah. Altogether, 40 properties are totaling 7,000 acres, including areas allowing dogs.
We are monitoring the situation and are taking steps to reduce overcrowding, including restricting overflow parking, limiting parking and adding COVID trail etiquette signage at busier locations, and working in partnership with the Sheriff’s Office to monitor traffic and overcrowding. We will continue to do everything we can to keep our parks open.

If it becomes evident that people continue to disregarding effective social distancing while visiting the Ottawa County parks and open spaces, we will have no other choice but to close them to protect the health of our community.

Stay Home - Stay Safe and Ice Cream Shops
The Ottawa County Department of Public Health food safety team appreciates the community’s concern about ensuring all food service establishments are operating safely and in accordance with the Stay Home - Stay Safe executive order. The order allows restaurants to stay open providing takeout, delivery or carry-out services. In Michigan, there is not a specific definition of “restaurant” in Act 92 of 2000 (Michigan Food Law). Instead, there are definitions of “food establishments” and “food service establishments”. Restaurants are categorized in the definition of food service establishments along with cafeterias, delis, sandwich shops, coffeehouses, bars and any other facility offering food or beverage for service to the public. In Michigan, local health departments issue fixed food licenses that covers all food service establishments.
Ottawa County does not separate establishments and sub-identify them within the definition of “food service establishment”. Additionally, there is a significant amount of overlap between all types of food service establishments (such as coffee shops selling soup or ice cream places selling hot dogs). Ice cream shops have the same license as what is typically thought of as a restaurant (fixed food license). Because Ottawa County is not distinguishing between different types of food service establishments, ice cream places are permitted to remain open providing they follow the guidelines in executive order. Sign up for food safety inspection reports. Select Public Health - Food Safety Reports & Education.

Ottawa Area ISD donates PPE supplies to county for distribution to frontline responders
The Ottawa Area ISD is working with the Ottawa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to help meet the personal protection equipment (PPE) needs of frontline responders in the Ottawa area during the COVID-19 crisis. This is just one of many positive outcomes that have occurred from a history of collaboration between education agencies, Ottawa County and first responder agencies. Careerline Tech Center, a service of Ottawa Area ISD, operates educational programs that provide real-world experiences and training for high school juniors and seniors in a variety of career fields including medical and public safety and security. These classes use the same personal protection equipment in their classroom learning activities that area first responders and hospitals need to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. READ MORE

“These donations came at a critical time when supply lines from the state and federal government were still forming and our frontline employees had a high need for PPE,” said Ottawa County Director of Emergency Manager Nick Bonstell. “Collaborative efforts like these demonstrate the strength of the EOC as a way to bring community groups with a common mission together.”

Anyone with PPE and materials, please consider donating to help keep frontline responders safe.

AG Nessel’s Office Sends Cease and Desist Letters toOnline Sellers for Price-gouging
Amazon Storefronts Taking Advantage of Consumers’ COVID-19 Fears
Four online sellers conducting business through Amazon were told to stop taking advantage of consumers by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel after her office found credible reports of price-gouging in violation of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act (MCPA).  The Attorney General’s office on Monday sent cease and desist letters to the Amazon storefronts operating under the usernames: Dealz N-KY, Happy Small Hands, HotDealz73, and ZXL Distribution Group.
These actions show the two different ways the Attorney General will seek to protect consumers making purchases in the Amazon marketplace. When a seller in a different state is involved, the Attorney General can employ the Michigan Consumer Protection Act to vindicate the rights of Michiganders who have been exploited. And, when the seller is in Michigan, the Attorney General can proceed to protect consumers everywhere. READ MORE

Healthcare Coverage Available to Michiganders who Lose Job or Experience a Drop in Income
Michiganders who lose a job, resulting in a loss of their healthcare coverage or a change in income, may have low or no-cost healthcare options available through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  Consumers in these situations are not required to wait for the yearly Open Enrollment Period and should act now.

“Michiganders who lose employer-based health insurance may have options to continue or replace their coverage,” said DIFS Director Anita G. Fox. “If consumers have questions about enrolling, DIFS is available to assist.”

Consumers have 60 days after losing essential health coverage, such as through a job loss, or experienced a change in income to take advantage of a Special Enrollment Period. To determine eligibility, consumers should visit www.healthcare.gov. Depending on income and their situation, consumers may qualify for cost sharing reductions, premium tax credits, coverage for their children (CHIP), or Medicaid. Consumers should contact DIFS toll free at 877-999-6442 if they need assistance. Act now and apply

When a consumer loses essential health coverage, they may be eligible to enroll in an individual health plan during a Special Enrollment Period. 
If consumers are new to www.healthcare.gov, they can create an account. If they already have one, they may log in to start or update an application.

Enrollment help is available 

DIFS can help.  The Michigan Health Insurance Consumer Assistance Program (HICAP) can provide shopping tips and help answer questions about health insurance or Special Enrollment Periods. 
Contact DIFS at 877-999-6442 or email at DIFS-HICAP@michigan.gov.

Ottawa County COVID-19 Statistics
As of April 6, 2020, Ottawa County has 46* positive COVID-19 cases, zero deaths and approximately 26% of positive cases have been hospitalized. Data are updated daily by 4 pm at miOttawa.org/miHealth. 
Since there is evidence of COVID-19 community spread, every location should be considered a potential risk. People of any age, even those who do not have any symptoms, could be a carrier of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. We all must do our part and Stay Home – Stay Safe – Save Lives. To slow the spread of the virus, we must adhere to social distancing and exceptional hygiene to minimize exposure and break the chain of infection.
*Case counts may differ from MDHHS if a case gets reassigned to another jurisdiction.

Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way COVID-19 spreads is through close contact from person-to-person in respiratory droplets from someone who is infected. How Coronavirus Spreads I CDC FAQs
However, mosquitoes and ticks can spread other diseases such as West Nile Virus and Lyme Disease. LEARN MORE

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to study the spread and effects of the novel coronavirus across the United States. We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (asymptomatic) and even those who eventually develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.
This means the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.

It is critical to emphasize that homemade cloth face coverings are not considered personal protection equipment (PPE) since their capability to protect is unknown. These can only be effective when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning (soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub) and maintaining 6-feet social distancing among people to slow the spread of the virus. 

The cloth face coverings recommended by the CDC are NOT surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.

Ottawa Area Schools provide free meals to school families during remote learning period
Schools throughout the Ottawa Area Intermediate School District service region continue to serve free meals to students while they continue their schooling outside the classroom. The week of March 22, the eleven K-12 public school districts combined served 94,688 meals to students, with breakfast making up nearly half of those meals. It’s important to note that the total number of meals served is actually much higher, as several charter and nonpublic schools are also distributing meals to students.
An interactive map of meal distribution locations is available on the Ottawa Area ISD website. The map is searchable by address or “use my location” information and may be accessed at oaisd.org/covid-19-freestudentmealsmap. If you or someone you know is experiencing food insecurity, ways to receive help can be found at www.oaisd.org.
Families should check with their local school or district for verification on times and locations before heading to meal distribution locations. Some addresses are "approximate locations" because they are at an intersection of roads, rather than a specific address. READ MORE

April is National Child Abuse Prevention Month
Since 1983, April has been designated as Child Abuse Prevention Month, and in 2020 we once again take this month to discuss how we each have a role in preventing child abuse and neglect. However, this year our efforts take on a different feel. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we are physically distancing ourselves from one another. While this type of isolation is helping to keep us all safe, for some families the isolation, stress, and economic uncertainty can create a higher risk of violence. In 2019 in Michigan, 33,060 children were abused or neglected – roughly 91 each day. Due to the research around the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), we know that this early trauma has detrimental health impacts throughout a person’s life.
In April, we look to the solution. Prevention of child abuse and neglect is necessary to change these difficult outcomes and create bright futures for our children. Since 2009, the blue pinwheel and the Pinwheels for Prevention Campaign have been the focus of April’s child abuse prevention awareness efforts. The pinwheel stands for the strong childhoods each child deserves and reminds us that we each play an important role in Standing UP for children. Together we can create change in our communities.

Governor Whitmer Reissues Executive Order Restricting Entry into Care Facilities, Juvenile Justice Facilities
Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed executive order 2020-37, which renews the restrictions on entry into care facilities and juvenile justice facilities the governor issued on March 14, 2020 until May 3, 2020. The order now requires facilities to use best efforts to facilitate remote visitations between individuals under their care and their loved ones, using phone or video conferencing software. The order also clarifies that “residential care facilities” include, but are not limited to, homes for the aged, nursing homes, adult foster care facilities, hospice facilities, substance abuse disorder residential facilities, independent living facilities, and assisted living facilities.

Most State Park, Trail and Boating Facilities Remain Open, but Social Distancing Must be Maintained
LANSING - To help slow the spread of the coronavirus and in accordance with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s "Stay Home, Stay Safe" Executive Order, the Department of Natural Resources continues to monitor visitation and adherence to social-distancing requirements at DNR-managed facilities. This means continually assessing needed adjustments to services and closures that best protect visitors, staff and the local communities.
A vast majority of state parks and recreation areas, state-managed trails and boating access sites remain open to provide local opportunities to get outdoors; however, all locations have modified services and/or closed amenities. 

"Throughout the stay-at-home order, we’ve seen an influx of visitors at state parks, boating access sites and trails," said Ron Olson, chief of the DNR Parks and Recreation Division. "In order to continue to keep state parks and trails open, we expect everyone to follow effective social distancing practices, to not litter and not travel long distances to enjoy the outdoors.
“If concerns continue to build, the DNR will have to look at closing or further limiting access to our state-designated trails, state parks, boating access sites and other outdoor locations,” he said.

As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and additional information has become available to state, health and DNR officials, the following reminders and announcements are in place. READ MORE

Ottawa County COVID-19 Statistics
As of April 3, 2020, Ottawa County has 35* positive COVID-19 cases, zero deaths and approximately 26% of positive cases have been hospitalized. Data are updated daily by 4 pm at miOttawa.org/miHealth. 
Since there is evidence of COVID-19 community spread, every location should be considered a potential risk. People of any age, even those who do not have any symptoms, could be a carrier of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. We all must do our part and Stay Home – Stay Safe – Save Lives. To slow the spread of the virus, we must adhere to social distancing and exceptional hygiene to minimize exposure and break the chain of infection.
*Case counts may differ from MDHHS if a case gets reassigned to another jurisdiction.

Why doesn't public health share how many positive cases are in each zip code?
We’ve had questions about people wanting to know how many positive cases are in each zip code listed at miOttawa.org/miHealth, how many have recovered and why are other health departments providing this information. We hear and understand people want to know more about where positive cases live. For confidentiality purposes, the Ottawa County Department of Public Health (OCDPH) will not be publishing case counts for specific zip codes, at this time.
Privacy can be compromised by releasing low counts by zip code level. However, as case counts increase and patient privacy can be assured, OCDPH will strongly consider publishing any relevant data to keep the public informed. Thankfully, at this time, Ottawa County does not have near the number of cases as seen in SE Michigan and other parts of the country.

Thank you, everyone, for staying home and staying safe! You are making a difference! #OttawaStaysHome

We hope you find this information a good start. As you can see, 11 of the 14 zip codes in the county have positive cases. This geographic spread is evidence of the virus’s presence in Ottawa County. Viruses do not discriminate based on location. Everyone should treat their immediate surrounding as if the virus is there.

We ask everyone to be patient and keep in mind:

Since there is evidence of COVID-19 community spread, every location should be considered a potential risk. Treat every person as though they are infected because the virus can go undetected in many people. People of any age, even those who do not have any symptoms, could be a carrier of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

Providing the public with information about where an infected person may have been, is not an effective measure of COVID-19 disease prevention. Similarly, with influenza (flu) circulating in the community, which could be anywhere and public health officials wouldn’t have complete information about every location where someone with flu has been.

If lab-confirmed positive COVID-19 cases increase, public health officials will reevaluate what data can be available to the public and post it at miOttawa.org/miHealth.

We all must do our part and Stay Home – Stay Safe – Save Lives. To slow the spread of the virus, we must adhere to social distancing and exceptional hygiene to minimize exposure and break the chain of infection.
Now is not the time to browse at grocery stores or congregate in neighborhoods or parks--no matter your age. We are well-positioned in Ottawa County to get through this together IF we all adhere to the community mitigation guidelines.

Take care of your physical and mental health during this difficult time. Many resources are available at miOttawa.org/miHealth. We will do all we can to meet our community’s needs and provide information and resources as they becomes available.

Just like you, county employees are members of our community who are also affected by this pandemic; working hard to get through this together!

Urgent Reminder from Parks & Recreation
We want residents to use and enjoy our parks and open spaces and the Stay Home order allows for this. But we ask them to be use social distancing. Parks are not areas of congregation at this time. If a parking lot is half-full or more, choose a different destination. You will most likely want to avoid Rosy Mound, Grand Ravines – including the dog park, Olive Shores, and Mount Pisgah. Altogether, there are 40 properties totaling 7,000 acres, including areas allowing dogs.
We are monitoring the situation and are taking steps to reduce overcrowding, including restricting overflow parking, limiting parking and adding COVID trail etiquette signage at busier locations, and working in partnership with the Sheriff’s Office to monitor traffic and overcrowding. We will continue to do everything we can to keep our parks open. If it becomes evident that people continue to disregarding effective social distancing while visiting the Ottawa County parks and open spaces, we will have no other choice but to close them to protect the health of our community.

Governor Whitmer Signs Executive Order Protecting Workers Who Stay Home, Stay Safe When They or Their Close Contacts Are Sick
Governor’s order also declares the state’s policy that those who test positive for or show symptoms of COVID-19 should stay in their homes, with few exceptions
Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-36, prohibiting all employers from discharging, disciplining, or otherwise retaliating against an employee for staying home from work if they or one of their close contacts tests positive for COVID-19 or has symptoms of the disease. Executive Order 2020-36 also strengthens the governor’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe” executive order by declaring that it is the public policy of the state that all Michiganders who test positive or show symptoms, or who live with someone who tests positive or shows symptoms, should not leave their homes unless absolutely necessary.

Nessel’s Office Tells Businesses to Stop SellingFake COVID-19 Test Kits

In continuing efforts to protect residents from scams and price-gouging related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office on Wednesday contacted two related businesses demanding they stop marketing and selling fake at-home COVID-19 test kits to Michigan consumers. 
The Attorney General’s letter was sent to VitaStik Inc. and $tronghold Inc. – both registered in Las Vegas, Nevada, but operating in Beverly Hills, California – after a concerned Michigan consumer reported the businesses’ website promoting at-home COVID-19 test kits. The kits were marketed at $25 each and described as being 96.3 percent accurate, with results available in 15 minutes.  
No such kits have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has warned consumers that all such promotions are scams.

6 Steps to Prevent COVID-19  I  Handwashing Guide I How to Protect Yourself Guide
CDC - What to do if you are sick  I  MDHHS Exposure Guide

Protect Yourself & Your Loved Ones
Cleaning 

Clean surfaces using soap and water.
Practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.
High touch surfaces include: tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets and sinks.

Disinfecting


Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty. Then, use a household disinfectant.


Follow the disinfectant instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Use an FDA-approved disinfectant. Many products recommend:

Keeping the surface wet for a period of time (see the product label).
Taking precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.




Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used, if appropriate, for the surface. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.

Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.
Leave the solution on the surface for at least 1 minute.
To make a bleach solution, mix: 5 tablespoons (1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water OR 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water




Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also an alternative.

Wash Your Hands!


Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a sick person.


Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available and hands are not visibly dirty, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.


Additional key times to clean hands include:

After blowing one’s nose, coughing or sneezing.
After using the restroom.
Before eating or preparing food.
After contact with animals or pets.
Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance.




Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

A message from the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Office and the Cultural Intelligence Committee of Ottawa County
Public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, have proven to be stressful times for people and communities. Fear, panic and anxiety that surrounds COVID-19 can lead to stigma towards people and places. Stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate COVID-19 with a certain nationality or population. COVID-19 stigma hurts everyone and does not exclude anyone based on race, gender, ethnicity, age or religion. COVID-19 can also have emotional and mental health effects on a stigmatized group and the communities that they reside in. Learn more at the Center for Disease and Control and Prevention
In Ottawa County (OC), we want to assure everyone this is a place where everyone belongs. We’re sharing with you a message from the Ottawa County Cultural Intelligence Committee (CIC) under the OC Department of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) about the stigma of this disease.

“During this stressful time, the CIC of OC encourages the community to not only combat the virus but also realize the dangerous stigma attached to it. COVID-19 is not more likely to exist in any race or nationality, nor was it created by any race or nationality. The CIC asks that we refrain from discriminating against others concerning COVID-19; knowing it can lead to racism if we do not recognize it.  Please speak up when one might hear language labeling COVID-19 as a part of any particular country, race or culture, and work to create a safe space for all. This global pandemic will most successfully be fought through unity; every human must be equally valued to keep us all safe and healthy.” – Judy Kettring, CIC Chair and Cynthia Smeyers, CIC Co-Chair

Viruses do not discriminate and neither should we. Coronavirus and Stigma - Know your facts

Coronavirus doesn’t recognize race, nationality or ethnicity. The 2019 coronavirus started in Wuhan, China. That’s just geography. Having Chinese ancestry, or any other ancestry doesn’t make a person more vulnerable to the illness.


Wearing a mask doesn’t always mean someone is ill. People wear masks for a variety of reasons.



Instead of spreading the stigma, spread the facts: Subscribe to the Ottawa County bulletins to receive updates and resources. Be sure to share or read one known fact with someone else and ask them to do the same.

What do you do if you or someone you know has had a racist act occur?
Anyone can contact the Michigan Department of Civil rights at INFO@michigan.gov or 1-800-482-3604 or the Department of Attorney General at HateCrimes@michigan.gov or 313-456-0200. 
If you witness an incident you can be an ally by standing closer to the person being harassed to let them know that they’re not alone.   You can also speak up if you see harassment and correct myths with facts if you hear them.

Ottawa County Parks Program and Events 
have been limited due to COVID-19, but we are adapting! Online and virtual nature programs are available. Please use and enjoy our parks and open spaces, but do so responsibly and safely, whether on a beach, in a forest, on a trail or in a parking lot. Parks mustn’t be areas of congregation at this time. If it becomes evident that people continue to disregard effective social distancing while visiting the Ottawa County parks and open spaces, we will have no other choice but to close them to protect the health of our community.
Please note that all restrooms and facilities, including playgrounds, are closed and in-person programs have been cancelled. We are offering some online/virtual nature programs, check them out below!
Here are some guidelines to follow if you venture out to a park:

Only visit parks on your own or with members of your household
Stay 6-10’ from others who are not in your household, on trails and in parking lots; it is essential that visitors are not congregating

If the park you normally visit is busy (lot more than half full), please considering visiting another location – you can find our full list of properties here

Wash your hands before and after your visit
Restrooms are not open, be sure to plan ahead
Pack out what you pack in

As the weather warms, ticks will return. Be sure to always check for ticks on yourself, children, and pets after you visit a park, especially if you have been off-trail. We recommend keeping a lint roller in the car to roll off clothes immediately following a hike, but it does not replace a more thorough tick check upon arriving home.

Ottawa Area ISD releases framework for remote learning during extended school closure 
Anticipating the potential for Governor Whitmer’s Executive Order (2020-35) to include extending school closure through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, Ottawa Area ISD assembled a Remote Learning Taskforce to develop a long-term plan to deliver alternative modes of instruction other than in-person for students.
Today, the task force announced a framework has been designed by educators in general, special, career/technical, and early childhood education to provide guidance around how a district, school, or program might think through developing a Remote Learning system for students and families. It is intended to guide thinking, reﬂection, and planning, rather than dictate what will work best for schools and their communities.

“We are relieved to have been provided clarity, and we are understandably concerned about the challenges of delivering quality instruction without direct contact with our students. We are committed to providing the very best we are able to deliver and to support all of our local schools, both public and private," said Pete Haines, Ottawa Area ISD Superintendent

Governor Whitmer Signs Executive Order Suspending Face-to-Face Learning at K-12 Schools for Remainder of School Year
Executive Order sets guidelines for remote learning, ensures teachers, school employees will be paid for remainder of school year
EO 2020-35
LANSING, Mich. — Governor Gretchen Whitmer today signed Executive Order 2020-35, which orders all K-12 school buildings to close for the remainder of the school year — unless restrictions are lifted — and ensures continuation of learning by setting guidelines for remote learning. District facilities may be used by public school employees and contractors for the purposes of facilitating learning at a distance while also practicing social distancing.

“My number one priority right now is protecting Michigan families from the spread of COVID-19. For the sake of our students, their families, and the more than 100,000 teachers and staff in our state, I have made the difficult decision to close our school facilities for the remainder of the school year,” Governor Whitmer said. “As a parent, I understand the challenge closing schools creates for parents and guardians across the state, which is why we are setting guidelines for schools to continue remote learning and ensuring parents have resources to continue their children’s education from the safety of their homes. There is no video chat or homework packet that can replace the value of a highly trained, experienced teacher working with students in a classroom, but we must continue to provide equitable educational opportunities for students during this public health crisis.”

Ottawa County COVID-19 Statistics
As of April 1, 2020, Ottawa County has 32 positive COVID-19 cases, zero deaths and approximately 22% of positive cases have been hospitalized. Data are updated daily by 4 pm at miOttawa.org/miHealth. 
Since there is evidence of COVID-19 community spread, every location should be considered a potential risk. People of any age, even those who do not have any symptoms, could be a carrier of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. We all must do our part and Stay Home – Stay Safe – Save Lives. To slow the spread of the virus, we must adhere to social distancing and exceptional hygiene to minimize exposure and break the chain of infection.

Helping Each Other Through the COVID-19 Crisis
Stress, anxiety and coping with emergencies and outbreaks can be concerning. We’re seeing people in our community who have heightened anxiety over job loss and social isolation. This is expected during crises but we want you to know that you’re not alone. Ottawa County has mental health experts and caring community members who are wanting to help. We have several mental health counseling services available in our community that offer telehealth. Many of them provide free or very low-cost services.

Call 211 for information about mental health providers and resources


Community Mental Health of Ottawa County Access Center 616-393-5681. For emergencies, please call the 24-hours crisis line at 1-866-512-4357.COVID-19 Emergency Operations Guide

Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA’s) Disaster Distress Helpline 1-800-985-5990


National Domestic Violence Hotline 1-800-799-7233


Supporting Children and Teens
Children and teens react, in part, on what they see from the adults around them. When parents and caregivers deal with the COVID-19 calmly and confidently, they can provide the best support for their children. Parents can be more reassuring to others around them, especially children, if they are better prepared.
Not all children and teens respond to stress in the same way. Some common changes to watch for include

Excessive crying or irritation in younger children
Returning to behaviors they have outgrown (for example, toileting accidents or bedwetting)
Excessive worry or sadness
Unhealthy eating or sleeping habits
Irritability and acting out behaviors in teens
Difficulty with attention and concentration
Avoidance of activities enjoyed in the past
Unexplained headaches or body pain
Use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs(Visit TalkSooner.org for guidance on talking with youth and substances)

How to Support Kids

Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand.

Reassure your child or teen that they are safe. Let them know it is ok if they feel upset. Share with them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you.

Limit your family’s exposure to news coverage of the event, including social media. Children may misinterpret what they hear and can be frightened about something they do not understand.

Try to keep up with regular routines. If schools are closed, create a schedule for learning activities and relaxing or fun activities.

Be a role model. Take breaks, get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well. Connect with your friends and family members.

Community Mental Health of Ottawa County (CMHOC) buildings are closed for walk-ins and visitors, but CMHOC is continuing to provide services by appointment or through telehealth. Telehealth means staff will provide services via phone calls, email and virtual meetings such as Zoom. During this time, CMHOC is continuing to accept new consumers to services. If you need behavioral health services, please call our Access Center at 616-393-5681. They will talk with you to determine the next steps.
If you are in a mental health crisis and need to speak with someone, please call our 24-hour Crisis Line at 866-512-4357. We have clinicians available 24/7 to provide confidential and anonymous support. CMHOC reminds people to pay attention to their mental health needs.
We will continue to provide services throughout this emergency. We are continuing to connect with people via telephone, virtual meetings and/or email. You are urged to call your assigned worker if you need help or support. We will get through this together.

Message from the Sheriff's Office 
The Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office is reminding people to meet deputies outside of structures for non-priority calls. This social distancing step will help to keep officers healthy and the department at full capacity.

Use the hashtag #OttawaStaysHome on all your social media platforms and tell us why you stay home and what you’re doing to occupy the time. The county will share its favorite posts, images and videos. Be creative! Visit Facebook.com/OttawaCounty.

The May 5th special elections will be held primarily by mail. This impacts Grand Haven Area Public Schools, Hudsonville Public Schools and Kenowa Hills Public Schools. Yesterday, all eligible voters were mailed absentee ballot applications. Voters should sign and return the application in the prepaid envelope. They will then receive a ballot mailed to them. Complete and return the ballot in the prepaid envelope. READ MORE

Parks Department
Public Health and the Parks are still moving ahead with Step it Up, with some changes to how the program looks this year. Step it Up is a an eight week walking program where participants track their minutes of activity. Registration is available at miottawa.org/StepitUp. Unlike other years of Step It Up, there will not be group walks this spring. Participants can still look forward to setting and achieving fitness goals, discovering new County parks, health tips, healthy eating ideas, incentive prizes, motivation and accountability. There is also a Workplace Wellness component this year. Reach out to the County if you would like more details on that. READ MORE
We want people to use and enjoy our parks and open spaces and the Stay Home – Stay Safe – Save Lives order allows for this. But we ask them to use social distancing. Parks are not areas of congregation at this time. If a parking lot is half-full or more, choose a different destination. You will most likely want to avoid Rosy Mound, Grand Ravines – including the dog park, Olive Shores and Mount Pisgah. Altogether, there are 40 properties totaling 7000 acres, including areas allowing dogs. They are listed at www.miOttawa.org/parks.
If it becomes evident that people continue to disregarding effective social distancing while visiting the Ottawa County parks and open spaces, we will have no other choice but to close them to protect the health of our community.

Updates from CareOttawaCounty.com

The funding collaborative as part of CareOttawaCounty.com (Community Foundation of Holland/Zeeland, Grand Haven Area Community Foundation and the Greater Ottawa County United Way) raised approximately $400K and gave away close to $200K to help support agencies on the front lines of addressing human services needs. LEARN MORE about donating.

The level of collaboration taking place is amazing, as usual for Ottawa County. On daily phone calls for CareOttawaCounty.com, pantries partner and place orders with Meijer; sharing oversupply of donated goods with one another.

A CareOttawaCounty.com campaign filled food boxes and delivered them to Community Action House, and more than 300 boxes were donated so far by community members. For each box donated, a group of companies and individuals matched the $45 donations. Lakewood Construction, PeopleIT, Holland Doctors of Audiology and The Insurance Group, Stacy Kamphuis and Mike/Rachel Goorhouse were the donors.

To get involved in the amazing collaborative community efforts, visit CareOttawaCounty.com or Facebook.com/Careottawacountycom.

U.S. Census Critical for Rural Communities
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is reminding Michiganders—particularly those who live and work in rural communities—of the importance of completing the 2020 U.S. Census.

“The Census is important to the entire state of Michigan, but it’s especially important to our rural communities,” said MDARD Director Gary McDowell in a new video. “It helps determine how much money Michigan receives for essential services like food assistance, health programs, and education. For farming and rural communities, the Census affects things like grants and loans for community facilities, rental assistance, and cooperative services like MSU Extension. For our state and our rural communities to be successful, it is very important that every person is counted.”

The Census is conducted only once every 10 years, so the data collected this year will be used to determine how much federal assistance is given to rural programs, such as business and industry loans, rural rental assistance, community and facilities loans, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), water and waste disposal systems, and many others. The Census also shapes Michigan’s congressional representation and impacts legislative districts.
The Census collects information about you and the people who live with you. All the information collected by the Census is confidential and will not be shared with anyone. It's mandated by the U.S. Constitution in Article 1, Section 2; the U.S. has counted its population every 10 years since 1790.
April 1 is recognized as National Census Day, and this is the first time that residents can respond online or by phone. The Census also can be completed using the traditional paper form. In May, the U.S. Census Bureau will begin following up in person with households that haven’t responded to the census.
For more information about the 2020 U.S. Census, visit www.michigan.gov/census2020 or www.2020Census.gov.

DIFS' Call Center Working Remotely to Assist Consumers with Insurance And Financial Services Questions And Complaints
The Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS) announced that its call center continues regular operations and remains prepared to assist Michigan consumers with their insurance and financial services concerns, especially those individuals impacted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 

“DIFS’ Office of Consumer Services is working remotely and stands ready to help Michiganders in need of assistance, especially with issues related to their health insurance and other coverages and financial services,” said Anita Fox, Director of DIFS. “At a time when consumers may be concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their lives, DIFS is here to help.” 

The call center consists of representatives that can assist with insurance, banking, credit union, mortgage and other consumer financial concerns. The Office of Consumer Services also has analysts available to review complaints against insurance or financial service entities. DIFS encourages consumers to first attempt to resolve disputes directly with their insurance and/or financial service provider. If a resolution cannot be reached, DIFS Office of Consumer Services can help try to resolve your dispute. The live call center can be reached by calling toll-free at 877-999-6442, and is available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.  

“Michigan consumers will not see a change in the way they obtain help from DIFS as we work remotely,” added Fox. “DIFS live call center team will continue to answer phones and address their needs.”  

DIFS stands ready to assist with:

Questions about health insurance coverage for COVID-19 treatment or testing.
Concerns about access to telemedicine.
Questions about the servicing of loans or mortgages.
Questions about banks or credit unions and the availability of financial services during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Insurance agent or consumer finance licensing questions.
Questions about insurance policies, grace periods, and premium payment extensions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Appealing an adverse decision regarding a health care claim under the Patient’s Right to Independent Review Act (PRIRA).

CDC - What to do if you are sick  I  MDHHS Exposure Guide

COVID-19 Infection
Public health officials are continually learning more about this new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. This includes its contagiousness and how long the virus can linger in the air or remain on surfaces.
The coronavirus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another. Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes (generally, up to six feet) may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into their lungs. Less commonly, the coronavirus can spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects when a person may touch their mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.
Sneezing and coughing can generate some aerosols, but they mostly generate larger fluid particles or droplets that can contain the virus. A recent National Institutes of Health study indicated aerosolized COVID-19 could remain in the air for up to three hours and the study also detected the virus could remain on various surfaces for times ranging from four hours to 72 hours. However, there is no evidence yet from this preliminary research on how likely a person is to actually get sick with COVID-19 by contacting a surface or breathing in the same air. Research continues on COVID-19 infectiousness and so far, the evidence indicates the highest risk is being within six feet for a prolonged period of time with someone else who has COVID-19.
What we know, at this point, is that COVID-19 is more contagious and deadlier than flu. A person infected with the new coronavirus can infect, on average, two to three people. Over time, each of those people can also infect two to three people and cause an exponential spread of disease in a population that has little to no immunity to it. We will provide more information as health professionals learn more about this new virus.
More about How Coronavirus Spreads



COVID-19 Fatality Rates
Preliminary data indicate the risk of death with this new coronavirus infection is commonly estimated at 1%. This is less than it was for SARS at approximately 11% and MERS at about 35%, but will likely be higher than the risk from seasonal flu, which averages about 0.1%.
The risk of death very much depends on a person’s age and overall health. Children appear to be at low risk of severe disease and death. Older adults and those who smoke or have chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease or lung disease have a higher chance of developing complications like pneumonia, which could be deadly.
With health officials gaining a better understanding of how the virus spreads, it reinforces the importance of social distancing and other health-promoting behaviors.

Updates from CareOttawaCounty.com
Local pantries have seen upwards of four times the demand last week over previous weeks and it is critically important we keep them well stocked. Please visit www.careottawacounty.com/en/donate-household-goods to see a list of frontline agencies and the most critical food and household good that they need right now or consider donating financially, so people can purchase these goods.
To help with isolated seniors who are at high-risk for COVID-19, we launched a grocery shopping model where seniors can Call 211 and request help. If they can afford their groceries, but would rather not go out because of safety precautions, a volunteer will do the shopping. The senior can reimburse the volunteer upon delivery. These volunteers have all had background checks and are credentialed through the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office, and they have badges when delivering groceries.
Pat McGinnis and the City of Grand Haven are referencing voter registration lists to identify older adults so city staff can call and check on their needs. This is encouragement for the whole community. Please call on those in your network, family and neighbors and make sure they have what they need. You can also direct people to Call 211 for any needs.
Blood supply is low and we strongly encourage people to continue to donate blood. Visit Versiti and American Red Cross for more information. According to the FDA, blood donation centers can facilitate the safe donation of blood because they are skilled in infection control practices and already have procedures in place to prevent the spread of infections. Donating blood is safe and takes only a little of your time. At many blood donation centers, those who are interested in donating can make an appointment to minimize the time it takes to donate blood. LEARN MORE

Beware of Fraudulent Coronavirus Tests, Vaccines and Treatments
With the Stay Home-Stay Safe order in place and people wanting to slow the spread of COVID-19, many may be tempted to buy or use questionable products that claim to help diagnose, treat, cure and even prevent COVID-19. Because COVID-19 has never been seen in humans before, there are currently no vaccines to prevent or drugs to treat COVID-19 approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is working with vaccine and drug manufacturers to develop new vaccines for and find drugs to treat COVID-19 as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, some people and companies are trying to profit from this pandemic by selling unproven and illegally marketed products that make false claims, such as being effective against the coronavirus. These fraudulent products that claim to cure, treat or prevent COVID-19 haven’t been evaluated by the FDA for safety and effectiveness and might be dangerous to you and your family. The FDA is particularly concerned that these deceptive and misleading products might cause Americans to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm. It’s likely that the products do not do what they claim, and the ingredients in them could cause adverse effects and could interact with, and potentially interfere with, essential medications.

Ottawa County's COVID-19 Response Update - Thursday, March 26, 2020
Ottawa County, Michigan sent this bulletin at 03/27/2020 12:52 AM EDT

Ottawa County Case Counts
Ottawa County has 18 positive COVID-19 cases as of 4 pm, Thursday, March 26. Positive case counts are updated daily by 4 pm at www.miOttawa.org/miHealth.
Think you may have been exposed?
Use this flowchart from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for guidance on what you should do. If you’re experiencing symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath, contact your health care provider to assess your condition and provide you with medical guidance.
People need to act as though the virus is present wherever they go in public because we are seeing community-wide spread in Ottawa County and across the state. This is why it is so important to practice social distancing and watch for symptoms.

Since there is no vaccine and no treatment for COVID-19, social distancing is the best defense we have at this time. It will take every one of us to break the chain of infection! Please do your part in protecting our community’s health and well-being. We all want life back to normal and the sooner we adhere to the disease control measures as outlined in the EO 2020-21, the sooner we can resume our lives.

 
Case Investigations
When a case is positive, public health nurses with our communicable disease team do a thorough investigation. They assess every reported encounter to determine their risk level. On a case-by-case basis, if it aides in case investigation and stopping the spread of disease, public health officials may notify places where higher risk exposures may have occurred and ask them to distribute a public health notice.

Providing the public with information about where an infected person may have been will depend on which virus we are dealing with, its risk of infection to the general public and where we are in the case investigation.

Health officials walk a fine line and have the difficult task of balancing a person’s confidentiality and providing public information. We understand it’s natural for people to want to know every location where a positive case may have been.

However, disclosing a location that has no to little risk to the public and does not help advance the disease investigation can create unnecessary public worry and potentially long-term damaging effects to those places of business, worship, school or any other location.

Updated information OCDPH's response at www.miOttawa.org/miHealth and on the Ottawa County or Public Health Facebook pages and Instagram.

Updated Information from the State
For at least the next three weeks, all Michigan businesses and operations must temporarily suspend in-person operations that are not necessary to sustain or protect life. Additionally, all Michiganders must stay in their homes unless they’re a part of that critical infrastructure workforce, engaged in an outdoor activity, or performing tasks necessary to the health and safety of themselves or their family, like going to the hospital or grocery store. 

Ottawa County strongly urges people to take the Stay Home-Stay Safe Executive Order seriously and adhere to it by maintaining at least six feet apart from one another (if you have to go out into public for essential services) and practicing exceptional personal hygiene to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The state released a helpful Guidance for Businesses to help clarify many questions. Guidance for Businesses I FAQs I Factsheet (English I Spanish)

Ottawa County Parks
The Stay Home-Stay Safe order allows people to ‘engage in outdoor activity, including walking, hiking, running, cycling, or any other recreational activity consistent with remaining at least six feet from people from outside the individual’s household. We want residents to use and enjoy our parks and open spaces, but we plead with them to do so safely. It is extremely important that parks are not areas of congregation at this time.

If it becomes evident that people continue to disregarding effective social distancing while visiting the Ottawa County parks and open spaces, we will have no other choice but to close them to protect the health of our community.

The five busiest parks are Rosy Mound, Mount Pisgah, Grand Ravines North, Grand Ravines Dog Park and Olive Shores. Please consider an alternative destination and with 40 parks and 7000 acres, there is space for all of us. 
More information at www.miOttawa.org/Parks.

Virus Don't DiscriminateNeither Should We
Misinformation about coronavirus can create fear and hostility that hurts people, leads to social stigma and makes it harder to keep everyone healthy. COVID-19 started in Wuhan, China. That's just geography. Having Chinese ancestry, or any other ancestry does not make a person more vulnerable to this illness. COVID-19 doesn't recognize race, nationality or ethnicity. People – including those of Asian descent – who do not live in or have not recently been in an area of the ongoing spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, or have not been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 are NOT at greater risk of spreading COVID-19 than other Americans
Stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality. Stigmatized groups may be subjected to social avoidance or rejection; denials of healthcare, education, housing or employment; physical violence; and more. Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. We’re stronger as a community when we stand together against discrimination.
Learn more about reducing stigma. Click for the toolkit.








City of Grand Haven Letter to Residents
You are not alone. Local officials are available around the clock to offer support and assistance during the COVID-19 crisis. We are repeating the message to stay in place, avoid direct social contact and help reduce the opportunity for this virus to spread. City staff remains on the job, either from home or in the field.
Read more from the City of Grand Haven.








Harbor Transit Limited Services
Harbor Transit has taken all necessary precautions to protect the health of its riders by limiting services, until further notice. We will only transport riders to doctor’s appointments, daycare centers for essential service workers, prescriptions, physical therapy, mental health and car repair. Trips to grocery stores will be limited to two per week, as a way to reduce exposure to drivers and passengers. Individuals who fall into a high-risk category and need testing should call 911 and get EMS transportation, not Harbor Transit. To help ensure the health of riders we have intensified cleaning and disinfecting of buses. These are done at the end of each shift, helping to ensure the vehicles are as clean and germ-free as possible.
Visit Harbor Transit's website for more schedule information.








SEMCO ENERGY continues emergency leak calls
SEMCO ENERGY will also continue performing essential service visits and following precautionary protocols. Most of the critical infrastructure work does not require access to the home and does not create an interruption of service. In these cases, please allow the technicians to conduct their work and please keep an appropriate social distance.

These products can clog pipes, tanks, pumps and treatment systems leading to backups and even system failure.
If the backups and system failures are severe enough, the sewer water may back up and flood your home or yard with human waste. Bathroom hygiene products other than toilet paper must be disposed of in the garbage. Please do your part and only flush toilet paper.

Case Investigations: Positive case counts will be updated daily by 4 pm on the website. Only positive case counts will be listed since COVID-19 laboratory testing has significantly increased throughout Michigan, making it difficult to know the exact number of submitted tests. With each confirmed positive case, the Ottawa County Department of Public Health (OCDPH) communicable disease team and epidemiologists conduct investigations to identify individuals who may have come into close contact with a case. If you have been identified to be at risk, the OCDPH will contact you and take the immediate and appropriate steps to monitor, quarantine or recommend you for testing. The OCDPH continues to collaborate with the state health department and health care providers to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. People should continue to practice disease prevention measures and follow state guidelines and restrictions. Testing information: Based upon the increase in COVID-19 cases statewide, people should act as though the virus may be present when they are in public places and should be taking all recommended prevention measures, including self-monitoring for signs or symptoms of COVID-19. If you feel well, you do not need to be tested. Mildly ill people are encouraged to contact their healthcare provider by phone for guidance. This will help prevent the additional spread of COVID-19 and save critical healthcare resources for those at high risk and who may need supportive care. DO NOT go in public even for essential services if you are not feeling well.





Our team at the Ottawa County Department of Public Health exemplifies equity, integrity and excellence. Our vision is for healthy people. We work with our community to help assure conditions that promote and protect health. We are dedicated to preventing diseases and providing evidence-based public health programs and services.

Ottawa County COVID-19 Response

Updates for Monday, March 23, 2020


13 positive COVID-19 cases in Ottawa County
Positive case counts will be updated daily by 4 pm on the website. Only positive case counts will be listed since COVID-19 laboratory testing has significantly increased throughout Michigan, making it difficult to know the exact number of submitted tests. With each confirmed positive case, the Ottawa County Department of Public Health (OCDPH) communicable disease team and epidemiologists conduct investigations to identify individuals who may have come into close contact with a case.

Homemade face masks
Ottawa County has had an overwhelming response from community members who want to help during the COVID-19 restrictions, particularly the need for medical supplies. With there being a shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) across the United States, we recognize that many people want to make face masks for high risk, vulnerable populations such as first responders, hospitals, shelters, long-term care facilities and other front-line staff.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that fabric masks are a crisis response option when other supplies have been exhausted. Keep in mind, homemade masks are not considered PPE since their capability to protect the health care provider or others is unknown. However, according to the CDC, if the only option for a mask is to have a homemade mask, these can only be effective when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning (soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub).

COVID-19: Second positive case in Ottawa County for Coronavirus Disease 2019
Ottawa County, Michigan sent this bulletin at 03/20/2020 04:59 PM EDT






Our Vision - Healthy People






March 20, 2020  |  Second positive case in Ottawa County
Additional positive COVID-19 case 
The Ottawa County Department of Public Health (OCDPH) was notified later today of another resident who tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The case is an adult female with no other information, at this time. OCDPH officials are working on the investigation and identifying contacts.   


"Based upon the increase in COVID-19 cases statewide, people should act as though the virus may be present when they are in public places and should, therefore, be taking all recommended prevention measures," said Dr. Heidel, OCDPH medical director. "If you feel well, you do not need to be tested. Mildly ill people are encouraged to stay home and contact their healthcare provider by phone for guidance. This will help prevent the additional spread and save critical healthcare resources for those at high risk and who may need supportive care."


Follow basic personal-hygiene measures to prevent the spread of the virus:

wash your hands often with soap and water or use hand sanitizer;
avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands;
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing;
avoid handshakes;
keep at least six feet apart from one another;
avoid contact with sick people who are sick; and
stay home when you are sick.

MDHHS COVID-19 Community Mitigation Strategies
Community mitigation strategies are crucial to slowing the transmission of coronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Michigan, particularly before a vaccine or treatment becomesavailable. These strategies provide essential protections to individuals at risk of severeillness and to health care and other critical infrastructure workforces. Preventing a sudden,sharp increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 will help minimizedisruptions to daily life and limit the demand on health care providers and facilities.
These recommended strategies apply at the individual, organizational, and communitylevels. They apply to businesses, workplaces, schools, community organizations, health careinstitutions, and individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and health profiles. Everyone hassome measure of responsibility to help limit the spread of this disease. Even individualswho are healthy can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others.
Michiganders have been preparing for COVID-19 for weeks, and all individuals shouldcontinue to take the following basic personal-hygiene measures to prevent the spread of thevirus:

cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing;
avoid handshakes;
avoid contact with sick people who are sick; and

Community Mitigation Guidance
With Governor Whitmer's announcement of two positive COVID-19 cases in Michigan on March 10, 2020 and with the state's community mitigation guidance on March 11, 2020, we understand there are many questions about what this may mean for your organization. The Ottawa County Department of Public Health (OCDPH) is working closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), county officials, healthcare providers, long-term care facilities, businesses, schools and so many more community organizations and members. We appreciate your patience as OCDPH health officials work through the COVID-19 response. Be assured, we are taking all the necessary steps to minimize the impact to our community. As of March 12, 2020, Ottawa County has no (0) confirmed positive cases of COVID-19.



The OCDPH's current guidance on community mitigation strategies aligns with the MDHHS Interim Recommendations for COVID-19 Community Mitigation Strategies dated March 11, 2020. This matter is rapidly evolving and we are expecting MDHHS to provide updated guidance. The most up-to-date information on these and other mitigation strategies is available at www.Michigan.gov/coronavirus. Additional school guidance information from the Ottawa Area Intermediate School District is schedule to be released later today.


"When making decisions about postponing or cancelling large gatherings, we urge you to consider strategies that provide protection to those at risk of severe illness such as older adults and those of any age with underlying medical conditions," said Dr. Heidel, OCDPH medical director. "Because each gathering is unique, please also consider the density of attendees, where the gathering is held and the duration of the event." 

We will keep our community informed as we receive updated and clarified information. Please share this bulletin with your networks. To stay up-to-date on the latest Ottawa County COVID-19 response, please sign-up here for our news releases and public updates.
