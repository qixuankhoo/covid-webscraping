City of Lynn Announces $2 Million in CARES  Act Funding
LYNN - The US Department of Housing and  Urban and Development (USDHUD) has awarded the City of Lynn $2 million in  federal funding through the Coronavirus relief bill, known as the CARES Act.  The funds are intended to prevent, prepare for and respond to the COVID-19  pandemic. 

The funds will be managed by the  City’s Community Development Office through the Community Development Block  Grant (CDBG) and Emergency Service Grant (ESG) programs. They will partner with  the Economic Development Industrial Corporation (EDIC) and the Lynn Housing  Authority and Neighborhood Development (LHAND) to administer the funding which  is subject to HUD regulations including prioritization of funding for residents  who have low and moderate income levels and businesses that retain or create  low and moderate income jobs. 

“This CARES Act funding will bring some relief to  residents, businesses, and non-profits within the City so they can pay  employees, leases, mortgages, rent and utility bills as they try to survive the  adverse economic effects of this pandemic,” said Mayor Thomas M. McGee. “This  much needed aid will also assist with caring for our most vulnerable  populations, costs associated with operating regional isolation and quarantine  locations, and investing in food security and distribution in our City.  Certainly there is substantial more work to be done to rebuild, but this is one  step in the right direction. ” 

“In developing a Lynn Emergency  Relief Fund proposal, the City formulated a plan based on input from local  businesses, residents, and what other cities and towns nationwide are utilizing  the funding for,” said Community Development Director James Marsh. “We have  been working with HUD and the National Community Development Association (NCDA)  over the last few weeks in formulating a plan for these much needed federal  dollars. We are grateful for these funds and are hopeful more funding is on its  way.” 

Lynn’s EDIC and Community Development Office will  administer $1 million in funding for grants of up to $10,000 to Lynn business  and non-profits impacted by COVID-19. Funds for businesses will be used to keep  workers employed, for property lease and mortgage payments, or other eligible  costs that will assist in keeping businesses afloat throughout the pandemic.  Funds for non-profits can be used to for services such as job training, providing  testing, increasing the availability health services, providing equipment,  supplies, and materials, or delivering meals to quarantined individuals that  need to maintain social distancing due to medical vulnerabilities. 

SMALL BUSINESS
The funding for businesses will be available through  an On-line Grant Application posted here and at www.ediclynn.org.

NON-PROFIT
Non-profit entities interested  in applying for funds should visit the Community Development website at www.cityoflynnoecd.net or call  781-586-6770.  All awards will be made based on need and adherence to HUD  regulations. 

“I  receive calls every day from businesses owners asking what we can do to help  them survive,” said EDIC Executive Director Jim Cowdell. “Our goal was to get  as much direct grant funding to them as fast as possible. We want to do all we  can to keep them viable through the pandemic.”  
The  Lynn Housing Authority & Neighborhood Development will administer funding  designated to assisting homeowners and tenants with monthly housing  expenses.  
LHAND  will utilize over $535,000 in funding for eligible homeowners and tenants that  have loss of income due to lack of work or loss of employment. Funds will be  used to assist households with rent or mortgage payments and utility arrearages  for a period of 3 months along with providing financial counseling amid the  pandemic. LHAND will also create an emergency response plan to assist the  organization’s continuity of operations and to help reduce the spread of  disease among residence, staff, and program participants. 
“Our  main concern is to get these funds out as quick as possible to homeowners and  tenants that have been affected and assist with their rent or mortgage,” said  Charles Gaeta, LHAND Executive Director. “This pandemic is affecting everyone  and people need relief. We want to help as many people as we possibly can with  these additional funds.”

For  tenants and homeowners that are looking for assistance, information can be  accessed through the online WaitListCheck portal of the Family Success Center  of LHAND at https://www.waitlistcheck.com/MA2977-1918   Information can also be obtained by calling the Family Success Center at  (339)  883-2342 or fsc@lhand.org.
In  addition, the City plans to utilize a portion of the funding to invest in food  security operations, to defray the costs associated with isolation and  quarantine locations for Lynn residents who cannot do so in their own living  environment, and to assist the Lynn Shelter Association with servicing our most  vulnerable populations during this heightened time of crisis.
A  complete listing of proposed activities and funding allocations will be  presented for further public review and comment on the City’s website, as the  City undertakes the task of amending its Federal Fiscal Year 2019 HUD Action  Plan and Citizens’ Participation Plan to facilitate the use of these  funds.   
   
Nationally, $5 billion  will be distributed through the US Department of Housing and Urban  Development's Community Development Fund under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and  Economic Security Act signed by the president on March 27th.

Social Distancing: What does it mean?


ENGLISH: Please see this article for tips on Social Distancing Tips you can take in your own life        to prevent the Spread of COVID-19:  The most obvious way to practice        social distancing is to avoid crowded public places where close contact        with others may occur. These might include movie theaters, religious        gatherings, and crowded restaurants. Of course, it’s not always easy to        practice social distancing. 

Tips and Tricks 
•Opt for online meetings rather than workplace gatherings whenever possible.

In light of the spread of COVID-19 infections nationally and internationally as well as reported cases in Massachusetts, North Shore Medical Center (NSMC) is joining colleagues from Partners Healthcare and taking measures to minimize potential exposure in our facilities and reduce the risk to our patients, staff and community. Effective immediately, we will be limiting visitors in the inpatient and outpatient facilities of NSMC and Salem Hospital, including our patient units, Emergency Department, Urgent Care Centers, Birthplace and outpatient facilities such as Labs, Imaging, Diagnostic Testing, clinics and other areas.

Masshealth Coverage of Testing and Treatment 


Union Hospital COVID Testing


The North Shore Medical Center’s Union Campus in Lynn will serve as a testing station for those concerned about whether they’ve contracted the COVID-19 virus.
North Shore Medical Center spokesman Matthew Roy said that drive-through testing tents will be set up adjacent to the urgent care center — formerly the Union emergency room.
“We are continually evaluating the needs of our patients and the best facilities to meet those needs,” Roy said late Thursday afternoon. “This site will serve patients of the North Shore Physicians Group and other Partners Healthcare-affiliated primary care practices.”
To access testing, patients must be phone-screened, pre-registered and scheduled through their primary care physicians, Roy said. Patients will remain in their cars while they are tested.

We would like to thank the Fireworks  Vendor Atlas Pyrovision Entertainment Group for their understanding and  cooperation with the cancellation of this year’s show. We are all looking  forward to another great event in 2021.

“Our communities are deeply rooted in history and patriotism and  we will continue to celebrate this in years to come. I would like to thank the  Fireworks Committee for their tireless work and our residents for their  understanding as we work to limit the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.” said  Mayor Thomas McGee.

“There is no doubt that the citizens of Lynn and Swampscott love  our country and our communities and our traditions so this great event will not  go away,” Fitzgerald said. “As a Nation, as a Commonwealth, as a City, and as a  Town— just know we are looking forward to a time we can all celebrate together  as a community."
LYNN & SWAMPSCOTT ANUNCIAN LA  CANCELACIÓN DE LOS FUEGOS ARTIFICIALES ANUAL DEL 3 DE JULIO
LYNN- A la luz de los tiempos sin  precedentes que estamos experimentando con la pandemia de COVID-19, el alcalde  de Lynn, Thomas McGee, y el administrador de la ciudad de Swampscott, Sean  Fitzgerald, juntos tomaron la difícil decisión de cancelar el tradicional  desfile y los fuegos artificiales del 3 de julio.

"Dado el tiempo incomparable en que  vivimos y la incertidumbre que enfrentamos, nuestra única opción era cancelar  los fuegos artificiales del 3 de julio para asegurar que nuestros residentes se  mantengan saludables", dijo el alcalde Thomas McGee. "La seguridad de  nuestros residentes ha sido y seguirá siendo mi principal preocupación durante  esta emergencia de salud pública".
“Todos estaremos un poco decepcionados de  que no podamos celebrar con nuestros amigos, vecinos y la comunidad en general  este año. Sí, todos sabemos que la seguridad y el bienestar de nuestras  comunidades y seres queridos es el tesoro más importante que tenemos ",  dijo Sean Fitzgerald, administrador de Swampscott.

La decisión es difícil para todos, ya que  este evento se ha convertido en una de las celebraciones más notables en el  Commonwealth, pero es fundamental para ayudar a prevenir la propagación de este  virus mortal. Nos gustaría agradecer al comerciante de Atlas Pyrovision  Entertainment Group por su comprensión y cooperación con la cancelación del  programa de este año. Todos esperamos otro gran evento en 2021.

“Nuestras comunidades están profundamente  arraigadas en la historia y el patriotismo y continuaremos celebrándolo en los  próximos años. Quisiera agradecer al Comité de Fuegos Artificiales por su  incansable trabajo y a nuestros residentes por su comprensión mientras  trabajamos para limitar la propagación del brote de COVID-19. " dijo el  alcalde Thomas McGee.

"No hay duda de que los ciudadanos de  Lynn y Swampscott aman nuestro país y nuestras comunidades y nuestras tradiciones,  por lo que este gran evento no se irá", dijo Fitzgerald. "Como  nación, como Estado Libre Asociado, como ciudad y como pueblo, solo sabemos que  estamos deseando que llegue el momento en que todos podamos celebrar juntos  como comunidad".

City of Lynn Announces $2 Million in CARES  Act Funding: May 12, 2020


The US Department of Housing and  Urban and Development (USDHUD) has awarded the City of Lynn $2 million in  federal funding through the Coronavirus relief bill, known as the CARES Act.  The funds are intended to prevent, prepare for and respond to the COVID-19  pandemic. 

The funds will be managed by the  City’s Community Development Office through the Community Development Block  Grant (CDBG) and Emergency Service Grant (ESG) programs. They will partner with  the Economic Development Industrial Corporation (EDIC) and the Lynn Housing  Authority and Neighborhood Development (LHAND) to administer the funding which  is subject to HUD regulations including prioritization of funding for residents  who have low and moderate income levels and businesses that retain or create  low and moderate income jobs. 

“This CARES Act funding will bring some relief to  residents, businesses, and non-profits within the City so they can pay  employees, leases, mortgages, rent and utility bills as they try to survive the  adverse economic effects of this pandemic,” said Mayor Thomas M. McGee. “This  much needed aid will also assist with caring for our most vulnerable  populations, costs associated with operating regional isolation and quarantine  locations, and investing in food security and distribution in our City.  Certainly there is substantial more work to be done to rebuild, but this is one  step in the right direction.” 

“In developing a Lynn Emergency  Relief Fund proposal, the City formulated a plan based on input from local  businesses, residents, and what other cities and towns nationwide are utilizing  the funding for,” said Community Development Director James Marsh. “We have  been working with HUD and the National Community Development Association (NCDA)  over the last few weeks in formulating a plan for these much needed federal  dollars. We are grateful for these funds and are hopeful more funding is on its  way.” 

Lynn’s EDIC and Community Development Office will  administer $1 million in funding for grants of up to $10,000 to Lynn business  and non-profits impacted by COVID-19. Funds for businesses will be used to keep  workers employed, for property lease and mortgage payments, or other eligible  costs that will assist in keeping businesses afloat throughout the pandemic.  Funds for non-profits can be used to for services such as job training, providing  testing, increasing the availability health services, providing equipment,  supplies, and materials, or delivering meals to quarantined individuals that  need to maintain social distancing due to medical vulnerabilities. 

SMALL BUSINESS
The funding for businesses will be available through  an On-line Grant Application posted here and at www.ediclynn.org.

NON-PROFIT
Non-profit entities interested  in applying for funds should visit the Community Development website at www.cityoflynnoecd.net or call  781-586-6770.  All awards will be made based on need and adherence to HUD  regulations. 

“I  receive calls every day from businesses owners asking what we can do to help  them survive,” said EDIC Executive Director Jim Cowdell. “Our goal was to get  as much direct grant funding to them as fast as possible. We want to do all we  can to keep them viable through the pandemic.”  
The  Lynn Housing Authority & Neighborhood Development will administer funding  designated to assisting homeowners and tenants with monthly housing  expenses.  
LHAND  will utilize over $535,000 in funding for eligible homeowners and tenants that  have loss of income due to lack of work or loss of employment. Funds will be  used to assist households with rent or mortgage payments and utility arrearages  for a period of 3 months along with providing financial counseling amid the  pandemic. LHAND will also create an emergency response plan to assist the  organization’s continuity of operations and to help reduce the spread of  disease among residence, staff, and program participants. 
“Our  main concern is to get these funds out as quick as possible to homeowners and  tenants that have been affected and assist with their rent or mortgage,” said  Charles Gaeta, LHAND Executive Director. “This pandemic is affecting everyone  and people need relief. We want to help as many people as we possibly can with  these additional funds.”

For  tenants and homeowners that are looking for assistance, information can be  accessed through the online WaitListCheck portal of the Family Success Center  of LHAND at https://www.waitlistcheck.com/MA2977-1918   Information can also be obtained by calling the Family Success Center at (339)  883-2342  or fsc@lhand.org.
In  addition, the City plans to utilize a portion of the funding to invest in food  security operations, to defray the costs associated with isolation and  quarantine locations for Lynn residents who cannot do so in their own living  environment, and to assist the Lynn Shelter Association with servicing our most  vulnerable populations during this heightened time of crisis.
A  complete listing of proposed activities and funding allocations will be  presented for further public review and comment on the City’s website, as the  City undertakes the task of amending its Federal Fiscal Year 2019 HUD Action  Plan and Citizens’ Participation Plan to facilitate the use of these  funds.   
   
Nationally, $5 billion  will be distributed through the US Department of Housing and Urban  Development's Community Development Fund under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and  Economic Security Act signed by the president on March 27th.

Mayor McGee Announces Executive Orders Requiring Residents To Stay At Home During Certain Hours and to Restrict Certain Activities Art All Times of the Day and Clarifying the Operation of Essential Services During The COVID-19 State of Emergency
Order Extended Until May 18, 2020 

Read The Lynn 
Curfew and Social Behavior Order (In English and Spanish)
Read The Essential Services Order (In English and Spanish)

Mayor Thomas M. McGee, in consultation with the City Council, the Department of Public Health, and the City Solicitor’s office, is announcing the issuance of two Executive Orders requiring residents and visitors to stay home during certain hours, to restrict certain behaviors at all times, and also relative to the operations of essential services. 

“As the outbreak of COVID-19 through person to person transmission continues to significantly affect the way of life and health of our community here in Lynn, we must take additional steps to prepare for, respond to, and mitigate the spread to protect the health and welfare of all us,” said Mayor Thomas M. McGee. “Therefore, I am issuing two Executive Orders to ensure that residents and businesses in Lynn act consistently with the imperative public health mandate. These orders will ensure that the entire community can achieve the maximum amount of social distancing, while continuing to provide and receive essential services, and ultimately slow the spread of COVID-19 to the maximum extent that we can. By taking these measures now, we get closer and closer to a time where we can all be together again. This requires patience and discipline as we all work together as one Lynn. I am confident that we will get through this crisis by standing firm, and emerge stronger than ever.”

The first order requires all residents of and visitors to the City of Lynn stay at home between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. unless they are actively providing or receiving COVID-19 essential services, and sick individuals are prohibited from leaving their homes unless to receive medical care. Additionally, it prohibits all non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason, and limits any concentration of individuals outside their home to workers providing essential services or individuals who are undertaking essential tasks. The order does allow for outdoor activity, but limited to activities that are non-contact or where you would come into close contact with other people.

The order also requires individuals to practice social distancing when in public and wear a cloth face covering, such as a fabric mask, scarf or bandana over their nose and mouth when entering any essential service business, in any communal spaces of a residential or commercial building complex, and when social distancing in public cannot be met. Surgical masks or N-95 respirators are not recommended for members of the general public in an effort to preserve medical PPE for healthcare workers and first responders. 

The second order is relative to the operations of essential services and puts in place a number of measures aimed at protecting both employees and customers and reducing the risk of community spread. All essential services must limit the number of customers and staff inside the establishment to 40% of their existing occupancy permit. Employees are required to wear face coverings when interacting with the public or a coworker, businesses must enact a plan for the regular cleaning and sanitizing of high touch surfaces and must have visible floor markings or signage that establish proper social distance between customers waiting to enter the business or waiting to check out. The order also imposes a zero tolerance policy for gathering and loitering of customers within stores’ premises or outside of a store upon completion of sale. 

The essential services order prohibits customers from entering restaurants, bars, and like establishments and instead allows business to be conducted in one of the following ways: drive-through window where customer remains inside a vehicle for the entire sales transaction including ordering, paying and receiving purchases; curbside pickup where a customer’s order is made in advance such as by phone or online and purchases are carried outside and delivered by employees upon the arrival at the establishment to the customer's vehicle or food delivery service’s vehicle; or, delivery where a customer places an order in advance and the purchases are delivered to a customer’s location by employees or food delivery service.

The last provision of this order prohibits landlords or owners from enforcing an eviction upon a resident of Lynn, including residential tenants and commercial tenants during this public health crisis. It also prohibits a landlord or owner from accessing a tenant’s dwelling space for purposes such as general inspections, displaying units to potential future tenants and other non-critical activities. A landlord may only access a tenant’s dwelling space to make repairs requested by the tenant, repairs required as a matter of law or to respond to a life threatening emergency. 

Both orders are effective Sunday, April 12th. Failure to comply with the provisions of the Executive Orders shall be a basis for the suspension/revocation of any and all City of Lynn licenses and permits and fines of up to $1,000.

El alcalde Thomas M. McGee, en consulta con el Concejo Municipal, el Departamento de Salud Pública y la oficina del Fiscal de la Ciudad, anuncia la emisión de dos Órdenes Ejecutivas que requieren que los residentes y visitantes permanezcan en sus hogares durante ciertas horas, para restringir ciertos comportamientos en todo momento, y también en relación con las operaciones de servicios esenciales.

Lea la orden de servicios esenciales

“Como el brote de COVID-19 a través de la transmisión de persona a persona continúa afectando significativamente la forma de vida y la salud de nuestra comunidad aquí en Lynn, debemos tomar medidas adicionales para prepararnos, responder y mitigar la propagación para proteger la salud y el bienestar de todos nosotros ", dijo el alcalde Thomas M. McGee. “Por lo tanto, estoy emitiendo dos órdenes ejecutivas para asegurar que los residentes y las empresas en Lynn actúen de manera consistente con el imperativo del mandato de salud pública. Estas órdenes asegurarán que toda la comunidad pueda lograr la máxima cantidad de distanciamiento social, mientras continúan brindando y recibiendo servicios esenciales y, en última instancia, disminuyen la propagación de COVID-19 en la medida de lo posible. Al tomar estas medidas ahora, nos acercamos cada vez más a un momento en el que todos podemos estar juntos de nuevo. Esto requiere paciencia y disciplina, ya que todos trabajamos juntos como una sola Lynn. Estoy seguro de que superaremos esta crisis si nos mantenemos firmes y saldremos más fuertes que nunca.”

La primera orden requiere que todos los residentes y visitantes de la Ciudad de Lynn se queden en casa entre las 9:00 p.m. y 6:00 a.m. a menos que estén proporcionando o recibiendo activamente los servicios esenciales COVID-19, y las personas enfermas tienen prohibido abandonar sus hogares a menos que reciban atención médica. Además, prohíbe todas las reuniones no esenciales de personas de cualquier tamaño por cualquier motivo, y limita cualquier concentración de personas fuera de su hogar a los trabajadores que prestan servicios esenciales o personas que realizan tareas esenciales. La orden permite actividades al aire libre, pero se limita a actividades que no son de contacto o en las que entraría en contacto cercano con otras personas.

La orden también requiere que las personas practiquen el distanciamiento social cuando están en público y que usen una cubierta de tela para la cara, como una máscara de tela, bufanda o pañuelo sobre la nariz y la boca al ingresar a cualquier negocio de servicios esenciales, en cualquier espacio comunitario de un edificio residencial o comercial y cuando el distanciamiento social en público no se puede cumplir. Las máscaras quirúrgicas o los respiradores N-95 no se recomiendan para los miembros del público en general en un esfuerzo por preservar el EPP médico para los trabajadores de la salud y los socorristas.

La  segunda orden es relativa a las operaciones de los servicios esenciales y establece una serie de medidas destinadas a proteger tanto a los empleados como a los clientes y reducir el riesgo de propagación a la comunidad. Todos los servicios esenciales deben limitar la cantidad de clientes y personal dentro del establecimiento al 40% de su permiso de ocupación existente. Se requiere que los empleados usen cubiertas para la cara cuando interactúan con el público o un compañero de trabajo, las empresas deben promulgar un plan para la limpieza y desinfección periódicas de las superficies de alto contacto y deben tener marcas visibles en el piso o señalización que establezca la distancia social adecuada entre los clientes que esperan ingresar negocios o esperando para pagar. El pedido también impone una política de cero tolerancia para reuniones y merodear de los clientes dentro de las instalaciones de las tiendas o fuera de una tienda al finalizar la venta.

La orden de servicios esenciales prohíbe a los clientes ingresar a restaurantes, bares y establecimientos similares y, en cambio, permite que los negocios se lleven a cabo de una de las siguientes maneras: ventana de paso donde el cliente permanece dentro de un vehículo durante la transacción de ventas entera, incluyendo pedidos, pagos y recibo de compras; recoger en la acera donde el pedido de un cliente se realiza por adelantado, como por teléfono o en línea, y las compras se llevan a cabo fuera y entregadas por los empleados a su llegada al establecimiento al vehículo del cliente o al vehículo del servicio de entrega a domicilio; o, la entrega donde un cliente hace un pedido por adelantado y las compras son entregadas a la ubicación de un cliente por los empleados o el servicio de entrega a domicilio.

La última disposición de esta orden prohíbe a los arrendadores o propietarios imponer un desalojo a un residente de Lynn, incluyendo a  los inquilinos residenciales y comerciales durante esta crisis de salud pública. También prohíbe que un arrendador o propietario acceda al espacio de vivienda de un inquilino para fines tales como inspecciones generales, exhibir unidades a futuros inquilinos potenciales y otras actividades no críticas. Un arrendador solo puede acceder al espacio de vivienda de un inquilino para hacer reparaciones solicitadas por el inquilino, reparaciones requeridas por ley o para responder a una emergencia que pone en peligro la vida.

Ambas órdenes son efectivas el domingo 12 de abril. El incumplimiento de las disposiciones de las órdenes ejecutivas será la base para la suspensión / revocación de todas y cada una de las licencias y permisos de la Ciudad de Lynn y multas de hasta $1,000.

City of Lynn COVID-19 Update:  April 6, 2020


Update  on Confirmed COVID Cases,  Deaths, Additional Recommendations

The Lynn Public Health Department has confirmed that as of today, April 6, 2020 the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has risen to 241 and 3 Lynn residents have died.  The patients have received the required quarantine instructions and officials within the Lynn Department of Public Health continue to monitor the positive cases and conduct extensive tracing investigations. All those people who have been confirmed to come in direct contact with these patients have been or will be notified by their local Board of Health.
Social and physical distancing remains the primary strategy to reduce the spread of COVID-19, as recommended by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). In addition to the guidance previously issued around social and physical distancing, which include staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more from others, today we are asking residents to wear a face covering over their mouth and nose whenever in public. It is advised that residents use cloth or homemade face covering, as opposed to a medical grade facemasks, in order to preserve personal protective equipment for health workers and those serving on the front lines in response to COVID-19.
“If you really want to support health care workers, first responders and other essential employees, please stay home,” said Mayor Thomas M. McGee. “The actions we are asking you to take now and over the course of the next several weeks will help curb the spread of this virus, and save lives, If you have to go out to pick up essential items, make sure you practice social distancing and stay 6 feet away from other at all times, wear a mouth and face coverings and continue to wash your hands often. We will get through this together as we continue to work towards mitigating community spread of COVID-19 and flattening the curve.”
The CDC estimates that nationally, 25 percent of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, and may not know they are a carrier of the virus, or that they could be infecting others.

We are strongly encouraging everyone to wear a face covering over their mouth and nose when in public:
•	In addition to practicing social distancing when going out in public for an essential trip to a supermarket or pharmacy, wearing face covers will help to reduce the risk of a person spreading the virus, especially if they do not know they are sick. 

•	Face coverings should be worn anytime someone is outside the home, including on walks or other passive recreational activities. 

• Face coverings should not be placed on children under 2 years of age, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance.

•	Face coverings can include a cloth, scarf, bandana, etc. that cover a person's mouth and nose. Homemade face coverings should be made of intact, close-weave cloth and allow comfortable breathing. Visit www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html for more information and guidance. 

•	Face coverings should be frequently washed using a washing machine with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. They can also be hand washed with soap and warm water and left to dry. 

Recommendations for people who are at higher risk:
•	People over 65 and those with underlying health conditions should be taking extra precautions. Trips outside the house should only be made when absolutely necessary, for either food or medications.

•	In addition, taking walks or spending time outside is discouraged for the next few weeks, and exercising inside the home instead is encouraged as an alternative. 

•	The underlying health conditions that can put someone more at risk are very common and include asthma, lung diseases such as COPD, diabetes, heart conditions, kidney or liver disease or conditions that can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment and smoking. 

According to the CDC, coronavirus is spread mainly through person-to-person contact. It’s believed that people who are in close contact (within 6 feet of one another) are most likely to spread it. It spreads through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of anyone nearby and may be inhaled into the lungs, which can spread the disease.

We will continue to provide regular updates on  COVID-19 on the City website, social media, and through the Smart 911 emergency  notification system as the situation evolves. We encourage all residents to  visit the City of Lynn Health Department “Coronavirus Resources”  page which includes information and links from the CDC, and to sign up for  the Smart 911 updates  at www.smart911.com.
As we work to mitigate this current public health emergency, we thank you for your patience, understanding, and cooperation during this time.

Actualización sobre casos confirmados de COVID-19, muertes relacionadas y recomendaciones adicionales

El Departamento de Salud Pública ha confirmada que a partir del 6 de abril de 2020, el número de casos confirmados de COVID-19 ha aumentado a 241 y 3 residentes de Lynn se han muerto.
Los pacientes han recibido instrucciones sobre los procedimientos de cuarentena necesarios a seguir. Los funcionarios del Departamento de Salud Pública de Lynn continúan monitoreando los casos positivos y realizan investigaciones exhaustivas de rastreo. Todas las personas que han sido confirmadas para entrar en contacto directo con estos pacientes han sido o serán notificadas por su Junta de Salud local.
El distanciamiento social y físico sigue siendo la estrategia principal para reducir la propagación de COVID-19, según lo recomendado por el Centro para el Control de Enfermedades (CDC). Además de la guía previamente emitida sobre el distanciamiento social y físico, que incluye quedarse en casa y mantener una distancia de 6 pies o más de los demás, hoy pedimos a los residentes a que se cubran la boca y la nariz siempre que estén en público. Se recomienda que los residentes usen telas o cubiertas faciales caseras, a diferencia de las mascarillas de grado médico, para preservar el equipo de protección para los trabajadores de la salud y aquellos que sirven en las líneas del frente en respuesta a COVID-19.
"Si realmente desea apoyar a los trabajadores de la salud, los socorristas y otros empleados esenciales, quédese en casa", dijo el alcalde Thomas M. McGee. "Las acciones que le pedimos que tome ahora y en el transcurso de las próximas semanas ayudarán a frenar la propagación de este virus y salvaran vidas. Si tiene que salir a recoger artículos esenciales, asegúrese de practicar el distanciamiento social y manténgase a 6 pies de distancia de los demás en todo momento, use una cubierta para la boca y la cara y continúe lavándose las manos con frecuencia. Lo superaremos juntos mientras continuamos trabajando para mitigar la propagación de la comunidad de COVID-19 y aplanar la curva.”
El CDC estima que a nivel nacional, el 25 por ciento de las personas infectadas con COVID-19 son asintomáticas y pueden no saber que son portadores del virus o que podrían estar infectando a otros.
Recomendamos encarecidamente a todos que se cubran la boca y la nariz cuando estén en público:
•	Además de practicar el distanciamiento social al salir en público para un viaje esencial a un supermercado o farmacia, usar cubiertas faciales ayudará a reducir el riesgo de que una persona propague el virus, especialmente si no saben que están enfermos.
•	Las cubiertas faciales deben usarse siempre que alguien esté fuera de la casa, incluso en caminatas u otras actividades recreativas pasivas.
o	Las cubiertas faciales no deben colocarse en niños menores de 2 años, cualquier persona que tenga problemas para respirar o que esté inconsciente, incapacitado o que de otra manera no pueda quitar la cubierta sin ayuda.
•	Las cubiertas faciales pueden incluir un paño, bufanda, pañuelo, etc. que cubran la boca y la nariz de una persona. Los revestimientos para el rostro hechos en casa deben estar hechos de tela intacta y tejida y permitir una respiración cómoda. Visite www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html para obtener más información y orientación.
•	Los revestimientos faciales se deben lavar con frecuencia usando una lavadora con detergente y agua caliente y secarlos en un ciclo caliente. También se pueden lavar a mano con jabón y agua tibia y dejar secar.
Recomendaciones para personas con mayor riesgo:
•	Las personas mayores de 65 años y aquellas con condiciones de salud subyacentes deben tomar precauciones adicionales. Los viajes fuera de la casa solo deben hacerse cuando sea absolutamente necesario, ya sea para comida o medicamentos.
•	Además, se desaconseja salir a caminar o pasar tiempo al aire libre durante las próximas semanas, y se recomienda hacer ejercicio dentro del hogar como alternativa. 
•	Las condiciones de salud subyacentes que pueden poner a una persona en mayor riesgo son muy comunes e incluyen asma, enfermedades pulmonares como COPD, diabetes, afecciones cardíacas, enfermedades renales o hepáticas o afecciones que pueden hacer que una persona esté inmunocomprometida, incluido el tratamiento del cáncer y el tabaquismo.

City of Lynn COVID-19 Update:  April 1, 2020


First Confirmed  COVID-19 Related Death in City of Lynn

Yesterday, the Lynn Board of Health was notified by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health of the first COVID-19 coronavirus related death within the City of Lynn. 
“My heart goes out to the family of the resident that died as a result of contracting COVID-19, as this global pandemic continues to hit home, for all of us, in such a terrible way,” said Mayor Thomas M. McGee. 
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has risen to 106. The patients have been instructed on the required quarantine procedures to follow. Officials within the Lynn Department of Public Health continue to monitor the patients and conduct extensive investigations into who the patients have come into contact with recently. All those people who have been confirmed to have come into direct contact with these patients have been or will be notified by their local Board of Health. 
“As we prepare for the COVID-19 outbreak to surge in Massachusetts within the upcoming weeks, it is vital that everyone within the City of Lynn follow the recommendations of the CDC and DPH to do the appropriate things to address this ongoing crisis including practicing social distancing and not gathering together in groups.” said Mayor Thomas M. McGee. “It is very important that we work together as a community during these challenging and unprecedented times. We strongly urge you to stay home and help save lives.”
“My thoughts and prayers are with the family,” said Public Health Director Michele Desmarais. “This is a difficult and challenging time and it is extremely important to continue to take the necessary recommended precautions of social distancing, washing hands and staying home from work if you are sick. Please stay home unless you have to go out for essentials, as this is key to mitigate community spread.”
The City is also announcing that all parks and the Lynn Woods reservation will continue to remain open to the public. However, in an effort to curb the amount of people using the area at one time, beginning tomorrow, the parking lots at Great Woods Road and Pennybrook Road will be closed. Residents may still enjoy the woods and parks, but must respect the social distancing guidelines by maintaining a distance of 6 feet, keeping dogs on a leash and away from others, practice responsible personal care and hygiene and clean up all of your personal trash. All residents need to play their part so that all parks can remain open and safe for all. Additionally the City has made the decision to close the Parkland Avenue Dog Park until further notice. Per Governor Baker’s Essential Services Order, all golf courses, including Gannon Municipal Golf Course, are closed. 

According to the CDC, coronavirus is spread mainly through person-to-person contact. It’s believed that people who are in close contact (within 6 feet of one another) are most likely to spread it. It spreads through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of anyone nearby and may be inhaled into the lungs, which can spread the disease.

While people of all ages can be infected with the virus, people who are considered to be at high risk of the coronavirus include older adults and those with serious, chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease. Residents who fit these criteria should take everyday precautions to keep space between themselves and others, limit close contact with those who are sick, and to avoid crowds, cruise travel and non-essential air travel as much as possible.

We will continue to provide regular updates on  COVID-19 on the City website, social media, and through the Smart 911 emergency  notification system as the situation evolves. We encourage all residents to  visit the City of Lynn Health Department “Coronavirus Resources”  page which includes information and links from the CDC, and to sign up for  the Smart 911 updates  at www.smart911.com.
As we work to mitigate this current public health emergency, we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding during this time.

Primera muerte relacionada con COVID-19 confirmada en la Ciudad de Lynn
Ayer, el Departamento de Salud Pública de Massachusetts notificó a la Junta de Salud de Lynn de la primera muerte relacionada con el COVID-19 coronavirus dentro de la ciudad de Lynn.
 "Mi corazón está con la familia del residente que murió como resultado de complicaciones de contractar el COVID-19, ya que esta pandemia global continua a golpear a todos, de una manera tan terrible", dijo el alcalde Thomas M. McGee.
El número de casos confirmados de COVID-19 ha aumentado a 106. Los pacientes han recibido instrucciones sobre los procedimientos de cuarentena que se requiere que sigan. Los funcionarios del Departamento de Salud Pública de Lynn continúan monitoreando a los pacientes y realizan investigaciones exhaustivas sobre con quién han tenido contacto recientemente. Todas las personas que se han confirmado de haber tenido contacto directo con estos pacientes han sido o serán notificadas por su Junta de Salud local. 
“Mientras nos preparamos para un incremento en el brote de COVID-19 en Massachusetts en las próximas semanas, es vital que todos en la ciudad de Lynn sigan las recomendaciones del CDC y el DPH y hacer lo apropiado para abordar esta crisis en curso, incluyendo la práctica de distanciamiento social y no reunirse en grupos ". dijo el alcalde Thomas M. McGee. “Es muy importante que trabajemos juntos como comunidad durante estos tiempos desafiantes y sin precedentes. Le recomendamos encarecidamente que se quede en casa y ayude a salvar vidas.” 
"Mis pensamientos y oraciones están con la familia", dijo la Directora de Salud Pública Michele Desmarais. “Este es un momento difícil y desafiante y es extremadamente importante continuar tomando las precauciones recomendadas necesarias de distanciamiento social, lavarse las manos y quedarse en casa del trabajo si está enfermo. Por favor, quédese en casa a menos que tenga que salir para algo esencial, ya que esta es la clave para mitigar la propagación a la comunidad.”
La Ciudad también anuncia que todos los parques y el área de Lynn Woods permanecerán abiertos al público. Sin embargo, en un esfuerzo por reducir la cantidad de personas que usan el área a la vez, a partir de mañana, los estacionamientos en Great Woods Road y Pennybrook Road estáran cerrados. Los residentes aún pueden disfrutar del bosque y los parques, pero deben respetar las recomendaciones de distanciamiento social manteniendo una distancia de 6 pies, manteniendo a los perros con una correa y lejos de los demás, practicando el cuidado personal e la higiene responsablemente y limpiando toda su basura personal. Todos los residentes deben cumplir su parte para que todos los parques puedan permanecer abiertos y seguros para todos.  Además, la Ciudad ha tomado la decisión de cerrar el parque de perros de Parkland Avenue hasta nuevo aviso. Según la Orden de Servicios Esenciales del Gobernador Baker, todos los campos de golf, incluido el Campo de Golf Municipal de Gannon, están cerrados.
Según el CDC, el coronavirus se transmite principalmente a través del contacto de persona a persona. Se cree que las personas que están en contacto cercano (a menos de 6 pies entre sí) tienen más probabilidades de propagarlo. Se propaga a través de las gotas respiratorias que se producen cuando una persona infectada tose o estornuda. Estas gotas pueden caer en la boca o la nariz de cualquier persona cercana y pueden inhalarse a los pulmones, lo que puede propagar la enfermedad.

Las personas de todas las edades pueden infectarse con el virus, las personas que se consideran en alto riesgo de contraer el coronavirus incluyen adultos de avanzada edad y aquellos con condiciones médicas graves y crónicas como enfermedades cardíacas, diabetes o enfermedades pulmonares. Los residentes que cumplan con estos criterios deben tomar precauciones diarias para mantener el espacio entre ellos y los demás, limitar el contacto cercano con aquellos que están enfermos y evitar la mayor cantidad posible de multitudes, viajes en crucero y viajes aéreos no esenciales.

Continuaremos brindando actualizaciones periódicas sobre COVID-19 en la página web de la Ciudad, las redes sociales y a través del sistema de notificación de emergencia Smart 911 a medida que la situación evolucione.

As we continue to work to mitigate  the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, we are urging residents of all ages to  practice intensive social distancing at all times. I want to emphasize that  necessary services such as supermarkets, pharmacies and gas stations will  remain open during this time. If you do need to leave your home to visit any of  these establishments, you should not bring your family with you. Additionally,  restaurants, bars and other retail establishments that sell food to the public  will remain open, for take-out and delivery only, provided that they follow  social distancing protocols and the prohibition of more than 10 people set  forth in the Department of Public Health guidance. 
Even if your business fits the criteria of a COVID-19  Essential Service put forward by the Governor, it is imperative that all  businesses and their employees abide by all of the social distancing and  hygiene recommendations below from the CDC & DPH to prevent community  spread:

Wash your       hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue and       dispose of any used materials. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth       with unwashed hands.
Stay home if you are sick and call your doctor.
Keep your distance from others - about 6 feet.

 The City of Lynn, the Emergency Management Team and our Department of Public Health continue to take proactive steps to slow community transmission of COVID-19 and prepare for further spread of the virus. The Board of Health has been notified by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health that we now have 28 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the City of Lynn, which includes 2 members of the city’s workforce. 
Both employees disclosed their conditions to the Department of Public Health, who then immediately contacted all city staff who may have been in close contact with the impacted employees and implemented self-quarantine procedures accordingly. The Lynn Public Health Department will continue to follow the same practices to track all active cases, monitor their symptoms and notify each of their confirmed contacts to self-quarantine. 
This weekend there is a Food Drive at Lynn City Hall on Saturday, March 28th & Sunday, March 29th from 11:00AM-3:00PM. Please donate any non-perishable food items in paper bags at the side parking lot of City Hall next to the Verizon Building.

McGee. “Residents are still able to go outside for a brief period of time to walk, run, or other types of exercise, but they must still follow the social distancing protocols of staying 6 feet away from others. The coronavirus is spread very easily from person to person, and individuals can still spread the virus even if they are not showing symptoms. We need to all work together to do our part to prevent community spread by practicing social distancing at all times."

El coronavirus se transmite muy fácilmente de persona a persona, y las personas aún pueden transmitir el virus incluso si no muestran síntomas. Necesitamos trabajar todos juntos para hacer nuestra parte para evitar la propagación de la comunidad mediante la práctica del distanciamiento social en todo momento".



 


City of Lynn COVID-19 Update:  March 25, 2020 - 5:30 PM


 The City of Lynn, the Emergency Management Team and our Department of Public Health continue to take proactive steps to slow community transmission of COVID-19 and prepare for further spread of the virus. The Board of Health has been notified by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health that we now have 7 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the City of Lynn. 
The patients are currently in quarantine in their home. Officials within the Lynn Department of Public Health will be actively monitoring the patients and conducting an extensive investigation into who the patients have come into contact with recently. All those people who have been confirmed to have come into direct contact with this patient will be notified by their local Board of Health. They will be instructed to stay at home and the Public Health Department will be in daily communication with them regarding their potential symptoms for fourteen (14) days. 
Today, Governor Baker announced at a press conference that all public and private schools and all non-emergency day care centers will be closed until Monday, May 4th. Earlier this week, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced a two week, “stay at home” advisory for all residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on March 23, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Grocery Stores, pharmacies, medical facilities and gas stations will remain open. 
“We are urging residents to follow the Governor’s Order and stay home to help us slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community,” said Mayor Thomas M. McGee. “The number of confirmed cases in the city, state and country continue to increase steadily as we test more individuals. I want to reassure everyone that there is no need to rush to grocery stores or gas stations—they will remain open. There is no need to stock up on items. Please continue to shop for essential supplies as you normally would to avoid overcrowding essential businesses. Moving forward, we must all pitch in to help prevent community spread by substantially limiting the number of times we leave our home, postponing any unnecessary meetings or gatherings, and practicing social distancing at all times.”
Actualización del COVID-19 de la Ciudad de Lynn
25 de marzo de 2020: La Ciudad de Lynn, el Equipo de Manejo de Emergencias y nuestro Departamento de Salud Pública continúan tomando medidas proactivas para frenar la transmisión comunitaria de COVID-19 y prepararse para una mayor propagación del virus. El Departamento de Salud Pública de Massachusetts ha notificado a la Junta de Salud que ahora tenemos 7 casos confirmados de COVID-19 en la ciudad de Lynn.
El paciente se encuentra actualmente en cuarentena en su casa. Los funcionarios del Departamento de Salud Pública de Lynn supervisarán activamente al paciente y realizarán una investigación exhaustiva sobre con quién se ha puesto en contacto recientemente. Todas las personas que se hayan confirmado haber tenido contacto directo con este paciente serán notificadas por su Junta de Salud local. Se les indicará que se queden en casa y el Departamento de Salud Pública se comunicara diariamente con ellos sobre sus posibles síntomas durante catorce (14) días.
Hoy, el gobernador Baker anunció en una conferencia de prensa que todas las escuelas públicas y privadas y todas las guarderías que no sean de emergencia permanecerán cerradas hasta el lunes 4 de mayo. A principios de esta semana, el Departamento de Salud Pública de Massachusetts anunció un aviso de "quedarse en casa" de dos semanas para todos los residentes del Estado de Massachusetts el 23 de marzo de 2020 para evitar la propagación de COVID-19. Los supermercados, farmacias, instalaciones médicas y estaciones de servicio permanecerán abiertos.
"Instamos a los residentes a seguir la Orden del Gobernador y quedarse en casa para ayudarnos a frenar la propagación de COVID-19 en nuestra comunidad", dijo el alcalde Thomas M. McGee. “El número de casos confirmados en la ciudad, el estado y el país continúa aumentando constantemente a medida que evaluamos a más personas. Quiero asegurarles a todos que no hay necesidad de apresurarse a los supermercados o estaciones de servicio, permanecerán abiertos. No hay necesidad de abastecerse de artículos. Continúe comprando suministros esenciales como lo haría normalmente para evitar el hacinamiento de negocios esenciales. En el futuro, todos debemos contribuir para evitar la propagación de la comunidad al limitar sustancialmente la cantidad de veces que salimos de nuestra casa, posponer cualquier reunión o reunión innecesaria y practicar el distanciamiento social en todo momento”.

Additionally, restaurants, bars and other retail establishments that sell food to the public will remain open, for take-out and delivery only, provided that they follow social distancing protocols set forth in the Department of Public Health Guidance. 
Even if your business fits the criteria of a COVID-19 Essential Service put forward by the Governor, it is imperative that all businesses and their employees abide by all of the social distancing and hygiene recommendations below from the CDC & DPH to prevent community spread:
•	Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

City of Lynn COVID-19 Update:  March 18, 2020
Actualización de COVID-18 del 16 de marzo 2020





The news surrounding  COVID-19 outbreak, commonly known as the coronavirus, is constantly changing  and rapidly evolving. Yesterday, I declared a State of Emergency within the  City of Lynn and today, the Lynn Board of Health has declared a Public Health  Emergency in order to protect the general health, safety and well-being of the  residents of the city.
Representatives from my  Office, members of the City Council, the Public Health Department, Office of  Emergency Management and first responders are in constant communication and  working with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health concerning  COVID-19.  I have also been in frequent contact with fellow mayors  throughout the region as well as our state and federal delegation.  
The city has been extensively  preparing for scenarios that can play out with the evolving COVID-19 situation.   We  will continue to provide regular updates on the City website, social  media, and the Smart 911 emergency notification system. Know that the tough decisions  we are making are necessary steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 here in  Lynn. 
In light of this truly  unparalleled situation, I have ordered the following:

Lynn       City Hall, the Department of Public Works, and the Lynn Public Library       will be closed to the public until further notice. This directive does NOT       apply to emergency services including Lynn Police and Fire. Residents are       highly encouraged to conduct their business with City Hall by phone,       email, or on the City website as much as possible, but should expect some       slight delays in response due to limited staffing;
All non-essential in-person governmental meetings and large group       gatherings will be postponed, suspended, canceled or held virtually.
The Lynn Public schools will be closed through Monday, April 6th       at a minimum per the Governor’s order for temporary closure of all K       through 12 schools throughout the state.   The Lynn       School District is still asking parents to plan to have child care       arrangements in place through April 17th. 

Grab and Go lunches will be available for all youth in the city        under the age of 18 daily between 11:00am and 1:00pm at the following        schools; Marshall Middle School, English High School, Classical High        School,  and Lynn Technical and Vocational High School. 
School resources are available to students by grades on the Lynn        Public School’s website. We highly encourage students to access these        resources daily.

Shows in the Lynn Auditorium are postponed through April 29th       and will be rescheduled for later dates.
All youth day care programs, senior adult day care programs, nail       salons, hair salons and barber shops, have been ordered closed by the Lynn       Department of Public Health through March 31st.
All       playground structures within the City of Lynn will be closed until further       notice. As the coronavirus can live on hard surfaces for up to 9 days, we       believe this is an unfortunate, but necessary step to take to prevent any       community spread. If you are heading to a City Park, please maintain       social distancing of at least 6 feet and do not engage in sports or       activities that require shared, physical contact. 

Lynn Water and Sewer and the  Lynn Housing Authority are also closed to the public until further notice.  Their clients are encouraged to conduct their business by phone, email, or  their agency’s respective websites. 

Governor Baker has prohibited  gatherings of over 25 people throughout the commonwealth and banned all in  person consumption of food or drink within any restaurant or bar. Food  establishments may remain open, but are limited to providing only take-out or  delivery service.
The most important way that  residents can help to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus is to  practice social distancing. Everyone can easily take the following precautions:

Wash your       hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.
Cover       your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue and dispose of any       used materials. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed       hands.
Stay home       if you are sick and call your doctor.

The CDC has  continued to say that those people at high risk for contracting the COVID-19  Coronavirus include older adults and people with serious, chronic medical  conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease. The CDC recommends  that residents who fit these criteria should take everyday precautions to keep  space between themselves and others, limit close contact with those who are  sick, and to avoid crowds, cruise travel and non-essential air travel as much  as possible. We want residents to know after speaking with numerous nursing  homes in the city, there are significant visitor restrictions in place to  protect the elderly. 

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) new  recommendations for recent travelers for the following countries: China, Iran,  Italy and South Korea, most of Europe and all of the United Kingdom &  Ireland. Anyone who has traveled to or from one of these countries is advised  to self-quarantine for 14 days since they left the affected area and take the  following recommended steps: 

Take your temperature with a       thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or       trouble breathing.
 Stay home and avoid       contact with others. Do not go to work or school for this 14-day period.       Discuss your work situation with your employer before returning to work.
Do not take public       transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during the time you are practicing       social distancing.
Avoid crowded places       (such as shopping centers and movie theaters) and limit your activities in       public. 
Keep your distance from others (about       6 feet or 2 meters). 

We encourage all residents to  visit the City of Lynn Health Department “Coronavirus Resources” page at lynnma.gov/coronavirus for more information and to sign up for the Smart  911 updates at smart911.com

I want all Lynn  residents to know we are united in our efforts to prevent the spread of  COVID-19. I also want to thank the Emergency Management team and City officials  who have been working tirelessly to ensure the City and our residents are  educated, prepared and safe for this evolving situation. We ask for your  patience and understanding as we deal with this truly unprecedented  circumstances for our community and country. We are working together to provide  you with the most accurate information available and advise you of all  developments. 

Thank you for your  help in partnering with us on this effort and please continue to visit the City  website, my Facebook Page for more updates, which I have asked to be shared by  members of the City Council and the School Committee so that we can ensure that  our unified message is reaching as many residents as possible.

Las noticias sobre el brote de  COVID-19, conocido como coronavirus, cambian constantemente y evolucionan  rápidamente. Ayer, yo declare un estado de emergencia dentro de la ciudad de  Lynn y hoy, la Junta de Salud de Lynn ha declarado una emergencia de salud  pública para proteger la salud general, la seguridad y el bienestar de los  residentes de la ciudad. 
Los representantes de mi Oficina,  los miembros del Consejo de la Ciudad, el Departamento de Salud Pública, la  Oficina de Manejo de Emergencias y los socorristas están en comunicación  constante y trabajan con el Departamento de Salud Pública de Massachusetts en  relación con COVID-19. También he estado en contacto frecuentemente con otros  alcaldes de la región, así como con nuestra delegación estatal y federal.
La ciudad se ha estado preparando  ampliamente para escenarios que pueden desarrollarse con la evolución de la  situación COVID-19. Continuaremos brindando actualizaciones periódicas en el  sitio web de la Ciudad, las redes sociales y el sistema de notificación de  emergencia Smart 911. Sepa que las decisiones difíciles que estamos tomando son  pasos necesarios para evitar la propagación de COVID-19 aquí en Lynn.
A la luz de esta situación  verdaderamente incomparable, he ordenado lo siguiente:

El Ayuntamiento de Lynn, el       Departamento de Obras Públicas y la Biblioteca Pública de Lynn estaran       cerrados al público hasta nuevo aviso. Esta directiva NO se aplica a los       servicios de emergencia, incluidos el departamento de policía y los       bomberos. Se recomienda encarecidamente a los residentes que realicen sus       negocios con el Ayuntamiento por teléfono, correo electrónico o en el       sitio web de la Ciudad tanto como sea posible, pero deben esperar algunas       demoras leves en la respuesta debido al personal limitado;
Todas las reuniones       gubernamentales no esenciales en persona y las reuniones de grupos grandes       se pospondrán, suspenderán, cancelarán o celebrarán virtualmente.
Las escuelas públicas de Lynn       estarán cerradas hasta el lunes 6 de abril como mínimo según la orden del       Gobernador para el cierre temporal de todas las escuelas de K a 12 en todo       el estado. El Distrito Escolar de Lynn todavía está pidiendo a los padres       que planeen tener arreglos de cuidado infantil en vigor hasta el 17 de       abril. 



Los almuerzos Grab and Go estarán        disponibles para todos los jóvenes de la ciudad menores de 18 años        diariamente entre las 11:00 am y la 1:00 pm en las siguientes escuelas;        Marshall Middle School, English High School, Classical High School y Lynn        Technical and Vocational High School.
Los recursos escolares están        disponibles para los estudiantes por grados en el sitio web de la Escuela        Pública de Lynn. Alentamos a los estudiantes a acceder a estos recursos        diariamente.

Los espectáculos en el Auditorio       Lynn se posponen hasta el 29 de abril y se reprogramarán para fechas       posteriores.
Todos los       programas de cuidado diurno para jóvenes, programas de cuidado diurno para       adultos mayores, salones de uñas, salones de belleza y peluquerías han       sido cerrados por el Departamento de Salud Pública de Lynn hasta el 31 de       marzo. 
Todos los       patios infantiles dentro de la ciudad de Lynn estarán cerradas hasta nuevo       aviso. Como el coronavirus puede vivir en superficies duras por hasta 9       días, creemos que este es un paso desafortunado pero necesario para evitar       la propagación de la comunidad. Si se dirige a un parque de la ciudad,       mantenga un distanciamiento social de al menos 6 pies y no participe en       deportes o actividades que requieran un contacto físico compartido.

Lynn Water and  Sewer y la Lynn Housing Authority también están cerrados al público hasta nuevo  aviso. Se alienta a sus clientes a realizar sus negocios por teléfono, correo  electrónico o los sitios web respectivos de su agencia. 
El gobernador  Baker ha prohibido las reuniones de más de 25 personas en todo el estado y ha  prohibido todo consumo de alimentos o bebidas en persona en cualquier  restaurante o bar. Los establecimientos de comida pueden permanecer abiertos,  pero se limitan a proporcionar solo servicio de comida para llevar o entrega. 
La forma más  importante en que los residentes pueden ayudar a prevenir la propagación del  coronavirus COVID-19 es practicar el distanciamiento social. Todos pueden tomar  fácilmente las siguientes precauciones: 
• Lávese las  manos con frecuencia con agua tibia y jabón durante al menos 20 segundos. 
• Cúbrase la tos  y los estornudos con el codo o un pañuelo desechable y deseche los materiales  usados. Evite tocarse los ojos, la nariz y la boca con las manos sin lavar. 
• Quédese en casa  si está enfermo y llame a su médico.
El CDC sigue  diciendo que las personas con alto riesgo de contraer el coronavirus COVID-19  incluyen adultos mayores y personas con condiciones medicas graves y cronicas  como enfermedades cardiacas, diabetes o enfermedades pulmonares. Los residentes  que cumplan con estos criterios deben tomar las precauciones diarias para  mantener el espacio entre ellos y los demás, limitar el contacto cercano con  las personas enfermas y evitar lo más posible las multitudes, los viajes en  crucero y los viajes aéreos no esenciales. Queremos que los residentes sepan  que después de hablar con numerosos hogares de ancianos en la ciudad, existen  restricciones significativas para los visitantes para proteger a los ancianos.  Nuevas recomendaciones del Centro para el Control de Enfermedades (CDC) para  viajeros recientes de los siguientes países: China, Irán, Italia y  Corea del Sur, la mayor parte de Europa y todo el Reino Unido e Irlanda. Se  recomienda a cualquier persona que haya viajado hacia o desde uno de estos  países que se ponga en cuarentena durante 14 días desde que abandonó el área  afectada y siga los siguientes pasos recomendados: 

• Tómese la  temperatura con un termómetro dos veces al día y controle la fiebre. También  esté atento a la tos o problemas para respirar.
• Quédese en casa y evite el contacto con otros. No vaya  al trabajo ni a la escuela durante este período de 14 días. Discuta su  situación laboral con su empleador antes de regresar a trabajar. 
• No tome  transporte público, taxis o viajes compartidos durante el tiempo que esté  practicando el distanciamiento social. 
• Evite lugares  concurridos (como centros comerciales y cines) y limite sus actividades en  público. 
• Mantenga su  distancia de los demás (aproximadamente 6 pies o 2 metros). 
Alentamos a todos  los residentes a que visiten la página de "Recursos de Coronavirus"  del Departamento de Salud de la Ciudad de Lynn en lynnma.gov/coronavirus para  obtener más información y suscribirse a las actualizaciones del Smart 911 en  smart911.com 
Quiero que todos  los residentes de Lynn sepan que estamos unidos en nuestros esfuerzos para  prevenir la propagación de COVID-19. También quiero agradecer al equipo de  Manejo de Emergencias y a los funcionarios de la Ciudad que han estado  trabajando incansablemente para garantizar que la Ciudad y nuestros residentes  estén educados, preparados y seguros para esta situación en constante evolución. Le pedimos su paciencia y comprensión al lidiar con estas  circunstancias verdaderamente sin precedentes para nuestra comunidad y país.

El alcalde  Thomas M. McGee declara un estado de emergencia dentro de la ciudad de Lynn


The City of Lynn is moving forward with measures to help  slow the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and lessen impacts on  healthcare providers responding to this evolving situation. Effective today,  March 16, 2020, Mayor Thomas McGee is declaring a State of Emergency in the  City of Lynn in order to protect the general health, safety and well-being of  the residents of the city.  This will give the Mayor and City Officials a  greater ability to respond to new developments. Lynn City Hall, the Department  of Public Works, and the Lynn Public Library will be closed to the public until  further notice. This directive does NOT apply to emergency services including  Lynn Police and Fire. 
In light of this truly unparalleled situation, the city is  taking these precautionary measures in order to reduce the potential spread of  COVID-19 within our own community. All city offices will be minimally staffed  to provide core municipal services. Residents are strongly encouraged to  conduct any City Hall business via phone or online, however residents should  anticipate slight delays in response due to limited staffing. Consideration  should be given to deferring matters that are not time sensitive. Residents can  call Lynn City Hall at 781-598-4000, Lynn DPW at 781-268-8000, or the Lynn  Public Library at 781-595-0567.

As a result of Governor Baker’s order to temporary close all  public and private elementary and secondary schools, the Lynn Public schools  will be closed through April 6th at a minimum. We still  ask parents to plan to have child care arrangements in place through April 17th.  Grab and Go lunches will be available for all youth in the city under the age  of 18 daily between 11:00am and 1:00pm at the selected schools; Marshall Middle  School, English High School, Classical High School,  and Lynn Technical  and Vocational High School. School resources will be made available to students  by grades on the Lynn Public School’s website. We highly encourage student’s  access these resources daily.
We are urging residents of all ages to regularly practice  social distancing in groups of any size. Yesterday Governor Baker announced  that gatherings of over 25 people and on premise consumption of food or drink  at any restaurant or bar are prohibited effective Tuesday, March 17th,  2020. The CDC recommends that organizations that serve people who are at  higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness, cancel events for groups of 10 people  or more.
We continue to encourage residents to take the following  precautions to prevent community spread:

Wash       your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.
Cover       your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue and dispose of any       used materials. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed       hands.
Stay       home if you are sick and call your doctor.

We will continue to provide regular updates on the  City website, social media, and through the Smart 911 emergency notification  system as the situation evolves. We encourage all residents to visit the City  of Lynn Health Department “Coronavirus Resources” page at  for more information and to sign up for the Smart 911 updates at 
As we work to mitigate this current public health emergency,  we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding during this time.  The city will continue to discuss its approaches to meeting the needs of the  public while keeping the health of everyone in mind.

City of Lynn COVID-19 Update:  March 13, 2020
Actualización de del 13 de marzo





With news of the COVID-19, commonly known as the  coronavirus, outbreak changing rapidly, I wanted you to hear from me and my  team about the steps we are taking to keep our city healthy and safe. The City  of Lynn including the Mayor’s Office, Public Health Department, Office of  Emergency Management and first responders are in communication and working with  the Massachusetts Department of Public Health concerning COVID-19. There  are currently no confirmed cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus in the City of  Lynn. The Lynn Public Health department is monitoring patients that have been  contacted by DPH as someone who has been exposed to a confirmed case of  COVID-19.  
The city has been preparing extensively to prepare for  scenarios that can play out with the evolving COVID-19 situation.  We will continue  to provide regular updates on the City website, social media, and the Smart 911  emergency notification system. Know that we are taking all necessary steps to potentially  prevent the spread of COVID-19 here in Lynn. 
Here’s what we are doing;

Residents       are encouraged to conduct their business with City Hall by phone or online       as much as possible;
All       non-essential in-person governmental meetings and large group gatherings       will be postponed suspended canceled or held virtually.
All       residents and private entities are advised to refrain from holding any       unnecessary large gatherings to reduce community spread of COVID-19 and we       thank those community organizations who have already taken action in this       regard.
The       Lynn Public schools will be closed until March 27th;

We        ask parents to plan to have child care arrangements in place        through April 17th
Grab        and Go lunches will be available for all students daily between 11:00am        and 1:00pm at the selected schools; Marshall Middle Schools, English High        School, Classical High School,  and Lynn Technical and Vocational        High School;
School        resources will be made available to students by grades on the Lynn Public        School’s website. We highly encourage student’s access these resources        daily.
All        Schools will be open for students and staff to retrieve their personal        items on Monday, March 16th from 8:00 am to 1:00pm

The       Lynn Auditorium shows are postponed through April 29th and will       be rescheduled for later dates.
 Please       continue to follow the City’s website and my Facebook page, (Tom McGee       mayor of Lynn) for official information on the city’s response to COVID-19

The CDC has said that high risk  populations include older adults and people with serious, chronic medical  conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease. The CDC recommends  that residents who fit these criteria should take everyday precautions to keep  space between themselves and others, limit close contact with those who are  sick, and to avoid crowds, cruise travel and non-essential air travel as much  as possible. We want residents to know after speaking with numerous nursing  homes in the city, there are significant visitor restrictions in place to  protect the elderly.
Unfortunately, widespread  coronavirus testing is still not widely available. All testing still needs to  be approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health which is causing a  lag in both the testing and diagnosing. 
State and Federal Health officials are encouraging residents  to take the following precautions, similar to those who may have symptoms of  the common cold, flu or other respiratory viruses:

Wash your hands often with       soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.
Cover your coughs and       sneezes with your elbow or a tissue and dispose of any used materials.       Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Stay home if you are sick       and call your doctor.

The  Center for Disease Control (CDC) released new recommendations for recent  travelers for the following countries: China, Iran, Italy and South Korea and  most of Europe. Anyone who has traveled to or from one of these countries is  advised to self-quarantine for 14 days since they left the affected area and take  the following recommended steps: 

Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and       monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or trouble breathing.
 Stay home and avoid       contact with others. Do not go to work or school for this 14-day period. Discuss       your work situation with your employer before returning to work.
Do not take public       transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during the time you are practicing       social distancing.
Avoid crowded places       (such as shopping centers and movie theaters) and limit your activities in       public.
Keep your distance from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters).

We encourage all residents to visit the City of Lynn Health  Department “Coronavirus Resources” webpage for more information and to sign up for the Smart  911 updates at 
I want all Lynn residents to know we  are united in our efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This is an  evolving situation and we ask your patience and understanding as we deal with  this truly unparalleled situation for our community and country. We will do our  best to keep you informed and advised of all developments. Thank you for your  help in partnering with us on this effort.

Actualmente, no hay casos confirmados del coronavirus COVID-19 en la  ciudad de Lynn. El departamento de Salud Pública de Lynn está monitoreando  pacientes que han sido contactados por DPH como alguien que ha estado expuesto  a un caso confirmado de COVID-19. 
La  ciudad se ha estado preparando ampliamente para escenarios que pueden  desarrollarse con la evolución de la situación COVID-19. Continuaremos  brindando actualizaciones periódicas en el sitio web de la Ciudad, las redes  sociales y el sistema de notificación de emergencia Smart 911.

El CDC ha dicho que las poblaciones de alto riesgo incluyen adultos mayores y personas con condiciones médicas graves y crónicas, como enfermedades cardíacas, diabetes o enfermedades pulmonares. El CDC recomienda que los residentes que cumplan con estos criterios tomen las precauciones diarias para mantener el espacio entre ellos y los demás, limitar el contacto cercano con las personas enfermas y evitar lo más posible las multitudes, los viajes en crucero y los viajes aéreos no esenciales. Queremos que los residentes sepan que después de hablar con numerosos hogares de ancianos en la ciudad, existen restricciones significativas para los visitantes para proteger a los ancianos.

Desafortunadamente, las pruebas generalizadas de coronavirus aún no están ampliamente disponibles. Todas las pruebas aún deben ser aprobadas por el Departamento de Salud Pública de Massachusetts, lo que está causando un retraso tanto en las pruebas como en el diagnóstico.

Los funcionarios de salud estatales y federales están alentando a los residentes a tomar las siguientes precauciones, similares a las que pueden tener síntomas de resfriado común, gripe u otros virus respiratorios:

• Lávese las manos con frecuencia con agua tibia y jabón durante al menos 20 segundos.
• Cúbrase la tos y los estornudos con el codo o un pañuelo desechable y deseche los materiales usados. Evite tocarse los ojos, la nariz y la boca con las manos sin lavar.
• Quédese en casa si está enfermo y llame a su médico.

El Centro para el Control de Enfermedades (CDC) publicó nuevas recomendaciones para viajeros recientes para los siguientes países: China, Irán, Italia, Corea del Sur y la mayor parte de Europa. Se recomienda a cualquier persona que haya viajado hacia o desde uno de estos países que se auto-imponga en cuarentena durante 14 días desde que abandonó el área afectada y siga los siguientes pasos recomendados:

• Tómese la temperatura con un termómetro dos veces al día y controle la fiebre. También esté atento a la tos o problemas para respirar.
• Quédese en casa y evite el contacto con otros. No vaya al trabajo ni a la escuela durante este período de 14 días. Discuta su situación laboral con su empleador antes de regresar a trabajar.
• No tome transporte público, taxis o viajes compartidos durante el tiempo que esté practicando el distanciamiento social.
• Evite lugares concurridos (como centros comerciales y cines) y limite sus actividades en público.
• Mantenga su distancia de los demás (aproximadamente 6 pies o 2 metros).

Statement from Mayor Thomas McGee - Posted March 27, 2020 - 6:30 PM

Today, Congress approved and sent to the President for signature the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. This bill was just approved by the Senate on Wednesday by the House Friday.  This package will provide much needed relief to residents, small businesses and municipalities.
“While we are staying apart from our friends and family, we are all sticking together to prevent community spread. I know this crisis is causing people significant economic hardship.” said Mayor Thomas M. McGee. “I would like to thank our Federal delegation for reaching across the aisle and working in a bipartisan manner to expedite the federal stimulus bill and get dollars into the hands of those that sorely need it. Here are some important portions of the bill that will directly impact our residents and small businesses to hopefully address some of the economic challenges we are facing”:
Direct Payments to Working Americans
-   Eligible households making below $75,000  (single) and ($150,000 married) will receive a payment of $1,200; plus an additional $500 payment per child,
-   The value begins decreasing and then phases out completely for those making over the full payment income cap.
 Unemployment insurance ($260 billion)
-   Vastly expands who is eligible for unemployment insurance. Unemployment will include not only payroll workers, but contract workers, gig workers, self-employed small business owners, those who are furloughed and not necessarily laid off, and others who are generally not eligible for unemployment benefits.
- Full paycheck replacement ($600 increase for every American, on top of state unemployment)
- 13-week extension of benefits
- Federal incentives for states to waive "waiting weeks" and get money in people's pockets sooner
 Small Business Rescue Plan ($377 billion)
-   $350 billion in loan forgiveness grants to small businesses and non-profits to maintain existing workforce and help pay for other expenses like rent, utilities, etc
- $10 billion for SBA emergency grants up to $10,000 to provide immediate relief for small business operating costs
- $17 billion for SBA to cover 6 months of payments for small businesses with existing SBA loans
Housing and Homelessness
- $4 billion for Emergency Solutions Grants for homelessness assistance;
-   $1.25 billion for the Housing Choice Voucher program;
- $1 billion for project based rental assistance;
- $685 million for public housing;
-   $65 million for Housing for Persons with AIDS;
- $50 million for Section 202 Housing for the Elderly; and
- $15 million for Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities.

I expect more information to be forthcoming in the upcoming days and weeks on how people and businesses can access those dollars. We will be updating information as we receive it on out web page at www.lynnma.gov<http://www.lynnma.gov> and via our social media.
We are living in unprecedented times and I want to assure you that we will get through this together.
Declaración del alcalde Thomas McGee
Hoy, el Congreso aprobó y envió al Presidente para la firma de la Ley de Ayuda, Alivio y Seguridad Económica de Coronavirus. Este proyecto de ley acaba de ser aprobado por el Senado el miércoles por la Cámara el viernes. Este paquete proporcionará un alivio muy necesario a los residentes, pequeñas empresas y municipios.
“Mientras nos mantenemos separados de nuestros amigos y familiares, todos estamos unidos para evitar la propagación de la comunidad. Sé que esta crisis está causando graves dificultades económicas a las personas.” dijo el alcalde Thomas M. McGee. “Me gustaría agradecer a nuestra delegación federal por llegar al otro lado del pasillo y trabajar de manera bipartidista para acelerar el proyecto de ley de estímulo federal y poner los dólares en las manos de aquellos que lo necesitan con urgencia. Aquí hay algunas partes importantes del proyecto de ley que impactarán directamente a nuestros residentes y pequeñas empresas para que con suerte puedan abordar algunos de los desafíos económicos que enfrentamos”:
Entiendo que el brote de COVID-19 ha causado un impacto significativamente adverso en muchos de nuestros residentes. Quisiera agradecer a nuestra delegación federal por llegar al otro lado del pasillo y trabajar de manera bipartidista para acelerar el proyecto de ley y poner los dólares en manos de aquellos que lo necesitan con urgencia. Me gustaría destacar algunas partes importantes de la factura que afectarán directamente a nuestros residentes y pequeñas empresas:
Pagos directos a los trabajadores estadounidenses
·         Los hogares elegibles que ganen menos de $ 75,000 (solteros) y ($ 150,000 casados) recibirán un pago de $ 1,200; más un pago adicional de $ 500 por niño,
·         El valor comienza a disminuir y luego desaparece por completo para aquellos que superan el límite de ingresos de pago completo.
Seguro de desempleo ($ 260 mil millones)
·         Se expande ampliamente quién es elegible para el seguro de desempleo. El desempleo incluirá no solo a los trabajadores de nómina, sino también a los trabajadores por contrato, los trabajadores por cuenta propia, los propietarios de pequeñas empresas por cuenta propia, los que están suspendidos y no necesariamente despedidos, y otros que generalmente no son elegibles para beneficios de desempleo.
·         Reemplazo total del cheque de pago (aumento de $ 600 por cada estadounidense, además del desempleo estatal)
·         extensión de beneficios de 13 semanas
·         Incentivos federales para que los estados renuncien a las "semanas de espera" y obtengan dinero en los bolsillos de las personas antes
Plan de rescate para pequeñas empresas ($ 377 mil millones)
·         $ 350 mil millones en subvenciones de condonación de préstamos a pequeñas empresas y organizaciones sin fines de lucro para mantener la fuerza laboral existente y ayudar a pagar otros gastos como alquiler, servicios públicos, etc.
·         $ 10 mil millones para subvenciones de emergencia de la SBA de hasta $ 10,000 para proporcionar alivio inmediato para los costos operativos de pequeñas empresas
·         $ 17 mil millones para que la SBA cubra 6 meses de pagos para pequeñas empresas con préstamos existentes de la SBA
Vivienda y personas sin hogar
·         $ 4 mil millones para Subvenciones de Soluciones de Emergencia para asistencia para personas sin hogar;
·         $ 1.25 mil millones para el programa de Vales de Elección de Vivienda;
·         $ 1 mil millones para asistencia de alquiler basada en proyectos;
·         $ 685 millones para vivienda pública;
·         $ 65 millones para viviendas para personas con SIDA;

First Confirmed Case of COVID-19 in the City of Lynn
March 21st 2020 

Today, Saturday, March 21, 2020 the Lynn Board of Health was notified by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the City of Lynn. 
The patient is currently in quarantine in their home. Officials within the Lynn Department of Public Health will be actively monitoring the patient and conducting an extensive investigation into who the patient has come into contact with recently. All those people who have been confirmed to have come into direct contact with this patient will be notified by their local Board of Health. They will be instructed to stay at home and the Public Health Department will be in daily communication with them regarding their potential symptoms for fourteen (14) days. 
“The City has a plan in place to effectively monitor this rapidly evolving situation of the COVID-19, coronavirus outbreak.” said Mayor Thomas McGee. “Now more than ever, it is vital that everyone within the City of Lynn follow the recommendations of the CDC and DPH to do the appropriate things to address this ongoing crisis including practicing social distancing and not gathering together in groups. We urge people to please follow these guidelines. I want residents to understand that moving forward, under any circumstances, supermarkets, pharmacies and gas stations will continue to be open, as they are essential services. If you do need to leave your home to visit any of these establishments, you should not bring your family with you. We must work together to prevent the spread of this virus in order to reduce the impact to our community.”
COVID-19 coronavirus is a respiratory illness with mild to severe symptoms. It is important to note that a majority of patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 have been able to recover on their own. The most common symptoms associated with COVID-19 include: fever, cough and shortness of breath. If you do exhibit symptoms, please first call your doctor and limit contact with other people. 
“When I was informed by DPH of the confirmed case, my team acted immediately to investigate the case. We have been prepared to address this issue for several weeks and will continue to work to do everything we can to ensure the safety of all Lynn residents.” said Michele Desmarais, Public Health Director. 
According to the CDC, coronavirus is spread mainly through person-to-person contact. It’s believed that people who are in close contact (within 6 feet of one another) are most likely to spread it. It spreads through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of anyone nearby and may be inhaled into the lungs, which can spread the disease. 
While people of all ages can be infected with the virus, people who are considered to be at high risk of the coronavirus include older adults and those with serious, chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease. Residents who fit these criteria should take everyday precautions to keep space between themselves and others, limit close contact with those who are sick, and to avoid crowds, cruise travel and non-essential air travel as much as possible.
The CDC and DPH recommend to take the following everyday precautions:
•	Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.
•	Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue and dispose of any used materials. 
•	Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
•	Stay home if you are sick and call your doctor.
These are the recommended steps from the CDC if must you self-quarantine:
•	Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or trouble breathing.
•	 Stay home and avoid contact with others. Do not go to work or school for this 14-day period. Discuss your work situation with your employer before returning to work.
•	Do not take public transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during the time you are practicing social distancing.
•	Avoid crowded places (such as shopping centers and movie theaters) and limit your activities in public.
•	Keep your distance from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters).
We will continue to provide regular updates on COVID-19 on the City website, social media, and through the Smart 911 emergency notification system as the situation evolves. 

We encourage all residents to visit the City of Lynn Health Department “Coronavirus Resources” lynnma.gov/coronavirus page which includes information and links from the CDC, and to sign up for the Smart 911 updates at smart911.com. As we work to mitigate this current public health emergency, we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding during this time.

Primer caso confirmado de COVID-19 en la ciudad de Lynn
Hoy, el sábado 21 de marzo de 2020, el Departamento de Salud Pública de Massachusetts notificó a la Junta de Salud de Lynn sobre el primer caso confirmado de COVID-19 en la Ciudad de Lynn.
El paciente se encuentra actualmente en cuarentena en su casa. Los funcionarios del Departamento de Salud Pública de Lynn supervisarán activamente al paciente y realizarán una investigación exhaustiva sobre con quién se ha puesto en contacto recientemente. Todas las personas que se hayan confirmado haber tenido contacto directo con este paciente serán notificadas por su Junta de Salud local. Se les indicará que se queden en casa y el Departamento de Salud Pública se comunicara diariamente con ellos sobre sus posibles síntomas durante catorce (14) días.
"La ciudad tiene un plan para monitorear efectivamente esta situación evolucionando rápidamente del brote de coronavirus COVID-19." dijo el alcalde Thomas McGee. “Ahora más que nunca, es vital que todos en la Ciudad de Lynn sigan las recomendaciones de los CDC y el DPH para hacer las cosas apropiadas para abordar esta crisis en curso, incluyendo la práctica del distanciamiento social y no reunirse en grupos. Les urgimos a las personas que sigan estas recomendaciones. Quiero que los residentes entiendan que, en cualquier caso, los supermercados, las bodegas, las farmacias y las gasolineras seguirán abiertos, ya que son servicios esenciales. Si necesita salir de su casa para visitar uno de estos establecimientos, no debe llevar su familia con usted. Tenemos que trabajar juntos para prevenir la propagación de este virus a fin de reducir el impacto en nuestra comunidad."
El coronavirus COVID-19 es una enfermedad respiratoria con síntomas de leves a severos. Es importante tener en cuenta que la mayoría de los pacientes que se han sido diagnosticados con COVID-19 han podido recuperarse. Los síntomas más comunes asociados con COVID-19 incluyen: fiebre, tos y dificultad para respirar. Si presenta síntomas, primero llame a su médico y limite el contacto con otras personas.
“Cuando DPH me informó del caso confirmado, mi equipo actuó de inmediato para investigar el caso. Hemos estado preparados para abordar este problema durante varias semanas y seguiremos trabajando para hacer todo lo posible para garantizar la seguridad de todos los residentes de Lynn." dijo Michele Desmarais, directora de salud pública.
Según el CDC, el coronavirus se transmite principalmente a través del contacto de persona a persona. Se cree que las personas que están en contacto cercano (a menos de 6 pies entre sí) tienen más probabilidades de propagarlo. Se propaga a través de las gotas respiratorias que se producen cuando una persona infectada tose o estornuda. Estas gotas pueden caer en la boca o la nariz de cualquier persona cercana y pueden inhalarse a los pulmones, lo que puede propagar la enfermedad.
Las personas de todas las edades pueden infectarse con el virus, las personas que se consideran en alto riesgo de contraer el coronavirus incluyen adultos de avanzada edad y aquellos con condiciones médicas graves y crónicas como enfermedades cardíacas, diabetes o enfermedades pulmonares. Los residentes que cumplan con estos criterios deben tomar precauciones diarias para mantener el espacio entre ellos y los demás, limitar el contacto cercano con aquellos que están enfermos y evitar la mayor cantidad posible de multitudes, viajes en crucero y viajes aéreos no esenciales.
Los CDC y DPH recomiendan tomar las siguientes precauciones diarias:
• Lávese las manos con frecuencia con agua tibia y jabón durante al menos 20 segundos.
• Cúbrase la tos y los estornudos con el codo o un pañuelo desechable y deseche los materiales usados.
• Evite tocarse los ojos, la nariz y la boca con las manos sin lavar.
• Quédese en casa si está enfermo y llame a su médico.
Estos son los pasos recomendados por el CDC si debe realizar la cuarentena:
• Tómese la temperatura con un termómetro dos veces al día y controle la fiebre. También esté atento a la tos o problemas para respirar.
• Quédese en casa y evite el contacto con otros. No vaya al trabajo ni a la escuela durante este período de 14 días. Discuta su situación laboral con su empleador antes de regresar a trabajar.
• No tome transporte público, taxis o viajes compartidos durante el tiempo que esté practicando el distanciamiento social.
• Evite lugares concurridos (como centros comerciales y cines) y limite sus actividades en público.
• Mantenga su distancia de los demás (aproximadamente 6 pies o 2 metros).
Continuaremos brindando actualizaciones periódicas sobre COVID-19 en la página web de la Ciudad, las redes sociales y a través del sistema de notificación de emergencia Smart 911 a medida que la situación evolucione. Alentamos a todos los residentes a visitar la página de "Recursos de Coronavirus" del Departamento de Salud de la Ciudad de Lynn, que incluye información y enlaces del CDC, y suscribirse a las actualizaciones de Smart 911 en www.smart911.com.
Mientras trabajamos para mitigar esta emergencia de salud pública actual, le agradecemos de antemano su paciencia y comprensión durante este tiempo.

North Shore Homeless Quarantine Site - Salem High School Fieldhouse


As part of Lynn and the region’s collective response to the ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency, the Cities of Lynn, Beverly, and Salem have worked jointly with the support of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), North Shore Community Health, Lynn Community Health, North Shore Medical Center, the Northeast Homeland Security Regional Advisory Council (NERAC), and Lifebridge to establish a temporary quarantine location for the region’s homeless population to be kept safe during the emergency.

The site is located at the Salem High School field house on Willson Avenue and is opening the week of April 6th for the duration of the emergency. Residents served by the Lynn Shelter Association, Lifebridge, and Riverhouse will be located at the facility for their own protection and for the protection of the general population, to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. 

“Establishing a temporary quarantine location for the most vulnerable populations has been a shared priority of the Mayors of the North Shore since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis,” said Mayor Thomas McGee of Lynn. “I want to especially thank those from our communities who have put many hours of work into the planning and launching of this operation. Together, we will do everything we can to ensure that those who face housing insecurity, will have a dignified place to shelter, as they are affected by the spread of COVID-19.” 
“While hundreds of thousands of residents across our three communities have the ability to shelter at home during this crisis, this smaller population of a few dozen individuals do not have that luxury,” said Mayor Kim Driscoll of Salem. “We have a shared responsibility to both them and to the rest of our constituents to meet this need thoughtfully, compassionately, and cooperatively.”

“We've all been working together to protect all our residents, including our most vulnerable who live in congregate settings like those housed in our shelters,” said Mayor Mike Cahill of Beverly. “This space at the Salem High School fieldhouse will provide critical protection for our homeless neighbors, allowing those possibly exposed to COVID-19 to self-quarantine in a safe space. I am grateful for Mayor Driscoll's leadership and for great partners like Mayor McGee, the team at Lifebridge, and our state partners, among many. We are committed to supporting this effort in every way possible.”
Frequently Asked Questions
Why have a quarantine site and why doesn’t each City have its own?
Quarantine of the homeless population is not possible in the existing shelters given space limitations and the need for safe social distancing. Due to the limited availability of resources for quarantine sites, the determination was made to approach the challenge on a regional and cooperative basis.
Why is this facility in Salem and not in Lynn or Beverly?
The Salem site has the appropriate layout to meet the needs for this population, including suitable space for personal accommodations, health services, and isolation. The fieldhouse can be physically separated from the rest of the high school, has scalable space in the event operations need to expand, and is near North Shore Medical Center, should medical services from the hospital be urgently required.
Will there be infected people here?
This is a quarantine facility, not an isolation or medical facility. Individuals at the fieldhouse are those who have not tested positive for COVID-19 but may have been in proximity to those who have. Where other people in those circumstances can quarantine comfortably at home, these individuals do not have that option and would either be in a more dense shelter setting, where they risk exposing other guests and staff of the shelter, or simply out in the community, where they risk exposing more of the general population.
What happens if someone at the facility becomes sick with COVID-19?
If someone at the site tests positive for COVID-19 they will be transported by MEMA and the state Department of Public Health to one of the state’s homeless isolation facilities, the nearest of which is, currently, in Lexington. The City does not anticipate that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will remain at the fieldhouse. While they await transportation, these individuals will be separated from the rest of the facility’s population in a different room.
Who is going to staff this facility?
The staffing of this facility will be a combination of Emergency Medical Technicians from Cataldo Ambulance and the local homeless service provider shelter staff from the three communities. These employees may be further supported by social work students from Salem State University and other community members who have a social work background and/or experience in this field.
Will individuals at the facility have medical and supportive services?
Yes. This is a higher needs population than the general population and all the necessary services they would typically receive at their regular local shelter will be provided at the quarantine site. This includes behavioral health and other supportive services. These services will be provided by the same specialists who serve them in their regular local shelter location.
Can anyone walk in to the site?
No. All guests will be referred in through the local shelters and organizations who work directly with homeless individuals. People who simply show up will not be admitted.
How are these individuals being transported to the facility?
Each community is arranging transportation on its own with their shelter providers. Transportation will be carried out by small-capacity vehicles in order to maintain safe social distancing for all.
Will there be security at the facility?
Yes, local police departments will be providing appropriate monitoring and/or details to ensure the safety of both the general public and the quarantined residents.
If someone at the facility has the virus, will the fieldhouse be cleaned? How long would the virus last on the surfaces there?
Whether or not any individual at the facility tests positive for COVID-19, the entire building will be sanitized and disinfected after the quarantine period concludes. In addition to this, routine cleaning will take place throughout the facility’s use as a quarantine site. On most of the hard surfaces of the building, the COVID-19 virus could live for three to four days, if not treated; however, the plan is to treat all surfaces regularly. No School Department employees will be responsible for on-site cleaning or maintenance.
Are Salem taxpayers paying for this?
Any costs incurred to operate this site will be shared jointly by the three communities and then reimbursed by FEMA, due to the federal emergency declaration.
Will this quarantine site still be operational if/when school reopens?
No. Schools would only be reopened if there was no longer a public health risk from COVID-19. In that event, the quarantine site would also no longer be necessary and would be closed and its residents returned to their regular local shelter sites in the three communities.
Sitio de cuarentena para personas sin hogar de North Shore
El Cobertizo de Salem High School
Como parte de la respuesta colectiva de la región y de Lynn a la emergencia de salud pública por curso de COVID-19, las ciudades de Lynn, Beverly, y Salem han trabajado conjuntamente con el apoyo de la Agencia de Manejo de Emergencias de Massachusetts (MEMA), North Shore Community Health, Lynn Community Health, North Shore Medical Center, el Consejo Asesor Regional de Seguridad Nacional del Nordeste (NERAC) y Lifebridge y establecerán una ubicación de cuarentena temporal para que la población sin hogar de la región se mantenga segura durante la emergencia.
El sitio está ubicado en el cobertizo de Salem High School en Willson Avenue y abrera la semana del 6 de abril por la duración de la emergencia. Los residentes atendidos por Lifebridge, Riverhouse y la Asociación de Refugios Lynn se ubicarán en las instalaciones para su propia protección y para la protección de la población en general, para ayudar a frenar la propagación del virus COVID-19. 
“El establecer una ubicación de cuarentena temporal para las poblaciones más vulnerables ha sido una prioridad compartida de los alcaldes de la costa norte desde el inicio de la crisis COVID-19", dijo el alcalde Thomas McGee de Lynn. “Quiero agradecer especialmente a aquellos de nuestras comunidades que han dedicado muchas horas de trabajo a la planificación y el lanzamiento de esta operación. Juntos, haremos todo lo posible para asegurarnos de que aquellos que enfrentan inseguridad de vivienda tengan un lugar digno para refugiarse, ya que se ven afectados por la propagación de COVID-19."
"Si bien cientos de miles de residentes en nuestras tres comunidades tienen la capacidad de refugiarse en sus hogares durante esta crisis, esta pequeña población de unas pocas docenas de personas no disfrutan de ese lujo", dijo el alcalde Kim Driscoll de Salem. "Tenemos una responsabilidad compartida tanto con ellos como con el resto de nuestros constituyentes para satisfacer esta necesidad de manera reflexiva, compasiva y cooperativa".
"Todos hemos estado trabajando juntos para proteger a todos nuestros residentes, incluidos los más vulnerables que viven en entornos congregados como los que se encuentran en nuestros refugios", dijo el alcalde Mike Cahill de Beverly. “Este espacio en el cobertizo de Salem High School proporcionará protección crítica para nuestros vecinos sin hogar, permitiendo a aquellos posiblemente expuestos a COVID-19 a auto-cuarentena en un espacio seguro. Estoy agradecido por el liderazgo del alcalde Driscoll y por los excelentes socios como el alcalde McGee, el equipo de Lifebridge y nuestros socios estatales, entre muchos. Estamos comprometidos a apoyar este esfuerzo en todas las formas posibles."
Preguntas frecuentes
¿Por qué tener un sitio de cuarentena y por qué cada ciudad no tiene el suyo?
La cuarentena de la población sin hogar no es posible en los refugios existentes debido a las limitaciones de espacio y la necesidad de un distanciamiento social seguro. Debido a la disponibilidad limitada de recursos para los sitios de cuarentena, se tomó la determinación de abordar el desafío a nivel regional y cooperativo.
¿Por qué esta instalación está en Salem y no en Lynn o Beverly?
El sitio de Salem tiene el diseño apropiado para satisfacer las necesidades de esta población, incluido el espacio adecuado para alojamiento personal, servicios de salud y aislamiento. El cobertizo se puede separar físicamente del resto de la escuela secundaria, tiene un espacio escalable en caso de que las operaciones deban expandirse y está cerca del Centro Médico North Shore, en caso de que se requieran urgentemente servicios médicos del hospital.
¿Habrán personas infectadas aquí?
Esta es una instalación de cuarentena, no una instalación de aislamiento o médica. Las personas en el campo son aquellas que no han dado positivo por COVID-19 pero pueden haber estado cerca de quienes sí lo han hecho. Cuando otras personas en esas circunstancias pueden poner en cuarentena cómodamente en casa, estas personas no tienen esa opción y estarían en un entorno de refugio más denso, donde corren el riesgo de exponer a otros huéspedes y al personal del refugio, o simplemente en la comunidad, donde corren el riesgo de exponer más a la población en general.
¿Qué sucede si alguien en el centro se enferma con COVID-19?
Si alguien en el sitio da positivo por COVID-19, MEMA y el Departamento de Salud Pública del estado lo transportarán a una de las instalaciones de aislamiento para personas sin hogar del estado, la más cercana de las cuales se encuentra actualmente en Lexington. La Ciudad no anticipa que cualquier persona que resulte positiva para COVID-19 permanecerá en el campo. Mientras esperan el transporte, estas personas se separarán del resto de la población de la instalación en una habitación diferente.
¿Quién va a dotar de personal a esta instalación?
La dotación de personal de esta instalación será una combinación de Técnicos Médicos de Emergencia de Cataldo Ambulance y el personal local del refugio de proveedores de servicios para personas sin hogar de las tres comunidades. Estos empleados pueden recibir más apoyo de los estudiantes de trabajo social de Salem State University y otros miembros de la comunidad que tengan experiencia y / o experiencia en el trabajo social en este campo.
¿Las personas en las instalaciones tendrán servicios médicos y de apoyo?
Si. Esta es una población con mayores necesidades que la población general y todos los servicios necesarios que normalmente recibirían en su refugio local regular se proporcionarán en el sitio de cuarentena. Esto incluye la salud del comportamiento y otros servicios de apoyo. Estos servicios serán proporcionados por los mismos especialistas que los atienden en su ubicación habitual de refugio local.
¿Alguien puede entrar al sitio?
No. Todos los invitados serán referidos a través de los refugios y organizaciones locales que trabajan directamente con personas sin hogar. Las personas que simplemente se presenten no serán admitidas.
¿Cómo se transporta a estas personas a la instalación?
Cada comunidad está organizando el transporte por su cuenta con sus proveedores de alojamiento. El transporte se llevará a cabo en vehículos de pequeña capacidad para mantener un distanciamiento social seguro para todos.
¿Habrá seguridad en las instalaciones?
Sí, los departamentos de policía locales proporcionarán monitoreo y / o detalles apropiados para garantizar la seguridad tanto del público en general como de los residentes en cuarentena.
¿Si alguien en la instalación tiene el virus, se limpiará la casa de campo? ¿Cuánto tiempo duraría el virus en las superficies allí?
Independientemente de si un individuo en la instalación da positivo por COVID-19, todo el edificio estara desinfectado y lo desinfectara después de que finalice el período de cuarentena. Además de esto, la limpieza de rutina se llevará a cabo durante todo el uso de la instalación como sitio de cuarentena. En la mayoría de las superficies duras del edificio, el virus COVID-19 podría vivir de tres a cuatro días, si no se trata; sin embargo, el plan es tratar todas las superficies regularmente. Ningún empleado del Departamento Escolar será responsable de la limpieza o mantenimiento en el sitio.
¿Los contribuyentes de Salem están pagando por esto?
Cualquier costo incurrido para operar este sitio será compartido conjuntamente por las tres comunidades y luego reembolsado por FEMA, debido a la declaración de emergencia federal.
¿Este sitio de cuarentena seguirá funcionando si / cuando la escuela vuelve a abrir?
No. Las escuelas solo se volverían a abrir si ya no existiera un riesgo para la salud pública debido a COVID-19. En ese caso, el sitio de cuarentena ya no sería necesario y se cerraría y sus residentes regresarían a sus refugios locales regulares en las tres comunidades.
