					COVID-19			

 

 

 








 
 
Two indicators of COVID-19 activity in an area are the trend of the number of weekly tests that are positive, and the percentage of weekly tests that are positive - which would take into account the total number of tests done.  In these graphs, the cases and tests are shown during the week the samples were collected, and not the week that the results were reported, which better illustrates the timeframe during which people were sick and seeking care.  In addition, the numbers may be adjusted as more results are reported and are added in to the total from the week that the test was collected.  This is especially true for the last week that is shown that may still have data that needs to be added when it comes in. 
 
Woodbury County has been experiencing downward trends since peaking in late April.  These results were achieved while the state was under Governor's orders for several mitigation strategies, several of which have now been relaxed.  It is important that we continue to practice measures that will slow the spread, including:
1. Staying home when even mildly ill
2. Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or elbow/upper arm. 
3. Washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
4. Limit gatherings to 10 or less individuals. 
5. Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from others.
6. Wear a mask, especially when maintaining distance is not possible.

WHAT IS COVID-19?
A novel (new) coronavirus has been causing an outbreak of illnesses that began in China and has now spread throughout much of the world including the United States.  The disease associated with this virus is being called COVID-19.
There are a lot of travel implications of COVID-19.  See below to find the latest advisories and recommendations.
 

Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19
   
What’s a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS and SARS. It's important to know that there are coronaviruses other than COVID-19 that are circulating routinely.
   
How is COVID-19 being spread?
Past history with coronavirus tells us that spread to close contacts (approximately 6 feet) usually occurs via respiratory droplets (when a person sneezes or coughs).Most of time people spread this virus when they are symptomatic. But there is evidence of at least some spread occuring from people that are not having symptoms.
  
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
Fever, cough, and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms.Confirmed cases have ranged from very mild or no symptoms to severe or life-threatening symptoms.CDC believes that people develop symptoms between 2-14 days after catching the virus.
 
What can I do to keep from getting it?
There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. Everyday precautions are the best way to prevent contact with the virus.

Regular hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

 
If I am ill, how long do I need to be isolated?
If you are ill, whether you have received a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis or not, stay home and isolate from others in the house until:
• You have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use of medicine that reduces fevers) AND
• Other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND
• At least 10 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared.
