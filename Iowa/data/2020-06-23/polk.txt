The web page serves a primary audience of school nurses, physicians and public health professionals.  The purpose of this report is to pass along relevant information about communicable disease, the prevention of communicable disease and learning opportunities that will allow the audience above to better serve the children and families in Polk County.For immunization questions, please email immunization.questions@polkcountyiowa.govMeningococcal Vaccine Secondary School RequirementThe Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH), Bureau of Immunization, has completed the administrative rule making process to require meningococcal (A, C W, Y) vaccine for students enrolling in 7th and 12th grades.  The administrative rule change was effective January 11, 2017, and will be implemented at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year.  The Immunization Program has developed a variety of materials regarding the new requirement.  The following resources are available on the Immunization Program’s webpage.The Immunization Program is committed to keeping you informed of school immunization requirements and looks forward to working with you during the implementation of the meningococcal vaccine requirement.  If you have questions regarding this change, contact the Immunization Program at 1-800-831-6293. Health Reporting SystemThe Polk County Health Reporting System is used daily by the Polk County Health Department to look for illness trends and potential outbreaks in the county.  The Polk County Health Department also provides support to individual schools by request and when absence rates are over 10% for students and/or staff.Having 10% or more students/staff absent on a given school day is reportable in Iowa.  Using the Polk County Health Reporting System is an easy way for schools to fulfill this state requirement. To access the Polk County Health Reporting System, you need a PIN/Username and a password.  Please contact Pat Sweeney at Pat.Sweeney@polkcountyiowa.gov or (515) 286-3667 with questions about your username, password and/or help accessing the system. Mumps Testing & PreventionIowa continues to have new mumps cases in multiple counties. From August 1 to October 3, 2016, 40 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in a total of 10 counties with the most cases in Black Hawk, Dubuque and Story counties.Here are some tips to reduce the spread of mumps in your community: For more information, visit idph.iowa.gov/cade/disease-information/mumps.MumpsWe continue to see cases of mumps in Iowa.  We can help to slow the spread by being alert for symptoms of mumps.  After exposure to mumps, symptoms typically appear 16 – 18 days after infection but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection.  Some people who get mumps may have very mild or no symptoms and may not know they have the disease.  The most common mumps symptoms are fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and swollen and tender salivary glands under the jaw (on one or both sides).Anyone with mumps symptoms should contact their health care provider.  Laboratory tests should be requested for anyone with mumps symptoms without other apparent cause, regardless of vaccination history. Both oral and blood tests are recommended by the PCHD and IDPH when testing for mumps. Anyone with suspected mumps should not participate in child care, school, work, or other public events until five days after symptoms began or until they are well, whichever is longer.  For more information, contact the PCHD CD Nurses at 286-3890.Polk County Communicable Disease in December 2016In the month of December, the Polk County Health Department investigated:Auditing Immunization and Dental CertificatesIt is that time again to begin the process of auditing Immunization and Dental Certificates.

A message from the 211 medical triage call centerOn behalf of the Polk County Health Department, United Way 211 and the hospital systems and clinics in the county, we want to thank all the nurses who donated their time answering the 211 medical triage line. Nurses from hospitals, clinics and schools along with medical students answered phones seven days a week responding to individuals concerned about their exposure to COVID-19, symptoms of the illness, how to get tested along with many other questions and concerns. When our hospitals and clinics were taxed, the nurses and medical students stepped up and provided guidance to aid the health and well-being of our community. We will be forever grateful for your service.United Way 211 and Polk County have always had a successful partnership during uncertain and often difficult times. The COVID-19 pandemic has not been any different.  The collaboration between 211, Polk County Medical Coordination Center, Polk County and our hospital systems have helped thousands of people in our community navigate their health care to lessen the burden on our medical system and prioritize healthcare needs in the community. 211 took on the medical triage call center without question. They knew it was the time when the community needed help and guidance and they were eager and happy to provide that assistance. We thank United Way 211 for stepping up and handling this momentous task with ease.As our healthcare systems have now adjusted to the ongoing demands surrounding COVID-19 and we have seen the numbers to our 211 medical triage line decrease, we will be winding down that line on Friday, May 22, 2020; however, 211 will still run 24/7 to answer COVID-19 related questions and help connect Iowans to information and resources they need.  We recommend patients contact their medical home regarding medical related COVID-19 questions. For other questions about COVID-19, or for help navigating any other health, human, or social service programs, please call 211.Donate homemade cloth masks!Broadlawns Medical Center: We are graciously collecting homemade masks. Please follow the IDPH guidelines listed above. If you have already made masks using another pattern, that's OK, we’ll accept those as well.

To coordinate a delivery of masks, please email foundation@broadlawns.org. The Iowa Clinic:Will accept homemade IDPH approved face shields and cloth masks at their West Lakes location (5950 University Ave – West Des Moines).

Is Polk County involved?Polk County EMA is in daily discussions with the State. We have submitted a list of questions and concerns. We are working with the State to address these.It seems like Polk County has the expertise it needs to contact sufficient contract tracing. Two questions: do you get the feeling that other Iowa counties are mastering this task or struggling with it? Question 2: how much money are you spending on the county’s COVID response, including contact tracing?Polk County has the expertise and the expert team to do this work but the sheer volume of positive cases is overwhelming our ability to do that. With Test Iowa coming online and up to 750 additional tests per day that would be going through the county at some time, it was no longer feasible for us to do this. The State has asked whether to turn the cases in to the county or to keep working on them. We know the majority of the counties have turned their cases over to the state.Question 2: Difficult question to answer at this point. Keith described how county departments are tracking those costs. We are doing everything we can to tie our objectives and the responsibilities we have with the cost to give us the best chance possible of reimbursement under the presidential disaster declaration. We are utilizing grants when possible. The donations have greatly beneficiated our team and community. Secondary benefit – the donations in our system can assign a market value to the donations and that helps offset a cost match under the presidential disaster declaration.How would a health care professional access or refer to the isolation center?Process up until now would come from the Polk County Health Department. The state would provide the county with the records and the county would provide follow up to the patient. The county would take to the patient about isolation and what their options and restrictions were and then make a referral to the shelter. Local providers who have knowledge that a person is positive and experiencing homeless should still go through the Polk County Health Department Communicable Disease team at 286-3890. They will talk through with the provider the same things…if there are any alternatives, medically stable and a positive test. Then the Health Department will work with the shelter on how to transport the person to the shelter. We would like to make sure providers send the patient with appropriate medications.Why isn’t more explanation being given to what we consider underlying conditions in our county and state? Also at what age does elderly begin?COVID-19 is a new disease that we have limited and evolving information regarding the risk factors. The CDC considers elderly people 65 years and older and people of any age who have an underlying health condition that may be at greater risk for severity and illness with COVID-19. A number of those types of conditions are those with chronic lung disease, heart conditions, immunocompromised, etc. The CDC does identify severe obesity of a body mass index of 40 or higher in additional to diabetes, chronic liver disease, kidney disease that can be a risk factor for severe disease with COVID-19. In Polk County, we have not seen a high association between obesity and severe disease but again, this is something that is evolving and we will learn more as we go further and see more illness and analyze illness trends.Seven confirmed cases in the jail. Have there been anymore?No new cases at the jail. We are still at 7 cases.How to wear a mask and how to store and dispose of masks properly? Or have the governor cover this in her daily briefing?A lot of recommendations out there for how to wear a mask. There is CDC guidance that has been shared by the EOC and Polk County Health Department. Visit Polk County website on the proper manufacturing and production of cloth masks and how to wear them.MercyOne was yellow coded for staffing, what exactly does this mean and are they short staffed to the point of impacting care?MercyOne is showing yellow and surging right now. Staffing is also surging a little. When you have more patients, you need more staff. Patient care is not compromised by any means. They do have staffing, its not short staffed. We are just seeing an uptick of what they need at their hospital.IDPH removing guidance for self-isolation if a person travels out of state, does Polk County have any guidance or is this no longer necessary?With widespread community transmission, limiting opportunities for exposure with social distancing and staying home as much as possible, those recommendations are still valid recommendations.Is there an adequate supply of level 3 face masks?Level 3 face mask is a very specific type of face mask. While it may look like a surgical mask, it provides a little bit better protection.  Unfortunately, our donations that we are receiving do not have that they are a level 3 labeled on them when they may be a level 3.  We have an adequate supply of face masks but cannot say there is an adequate supply of level 3.Are some of the PPE donations coming from businesses, and if so, will their personnel be appropriately protected as their business operations resume or continue?We are receiving excess PPE from businesses and not what they would need to protect their staff.Are there any guidelines for summer camps such as a number of children or space or whether or not it should even happen?Refer that question to IDPH and the Governor’s office.How are we monitoring residents in Polk County who are possibly traveling to from other counties that are slowly  are opening?We do not have a mechanism to monitor people who are traveling between open and closed counties. I’ve been told that the meat packers are busing people from closed plants to open plants. Do you know about this and if so, what are we doing about it?Polk County EMA, Dallas County EMA, Polk County Health Department and Dallas County Health Department have worked closely and directly with Tyson and we think that resulted with doing surveillance testing in the last couple of days. We will continue to work with Tyson and anyone else in other situations.How are we going to get tested done for those who may have had the virus as early as December, January or February and didn’t know what the lung infection was. Maybe a number of have it and have the immunity?As Serology tests become available, those test results will tell us who has immunity to the virus and who does not. We do not think there has been any conclusive studies to show how protective the antibody response is to the virus and if you can or cannot get it one or more times.   Are local and country residents being screened and temperature checks? How do you differentiate from allergies and COVID-19?We cannot speak to what the cities are doing. At the county level, employees are being screened and temperature checks. It is very difficult to be able to differentiate between allergies and other respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. That is why our guidance has been to stay away from others if they are having symptoms. People who have known allergies that offers them a baseline that they can determine or not if their symptoms are consistent or not with normal allergy season for them or something above and beyond what they typically experience.Linn County has created a specific county dashboard. Can we do something similar?We can have a discussion between Polk County EMA, Polk County Health Department and Polk County IT to see if this is something they can do.After talking to labs, serology testing can only show there has been exposure to coronavirus and not COVID-19.This is new testing that is coming out so as serology testing is approved, there will be information that accompanies that testing that tells us what information is provided by a positive result and what limitations there may be with that testing.It seems like Polk County has the expertise it needs to contact sufficient contract tracing. Two questions: do you get the feeling that other Iowa counties are mastering this task or struggling with it? Question 2: how much money are you spending on the county’s COVID response, including contact tracing?Polk County has the expertise and the expert team to do this work but the sheer volume of positive cases is overwhelming our ability to do that. With Test Iowa coming online and up to 750 additional tests per day that would be going through the county at some time, it was no longer feasible for us to do this. The State has asked whether to turn the cases in to the county or to keep working on them. We know the majority of the counties have turned their cases over to the state.Question 2: Difficult question to answer at this point. Keith described how county departments are tracking those costs. We are doing everything we can to tie our objectives and the responsibilities we have with the cost to give us the best chance possible of reimbursement under the presidential disaster declaration. We are utilizing grants when possible. The donations have greatly beneficiated our team and community. Secondary benefit – the donations in our system can assign a market value to the donations and that helps offset a cost match under the presidential disaster declaration.How would a health care professional access or refer to the isolation center?Process up until now would come from the Polk County Health Department. The state would provide the county with the records and the county would provide follow up to the patient. The county would take to the patient about isolation and what their options and restrictions were and then make a referral to the shelter. Local providers who have knowledge that a person is positive and experiencing homeless should still go through the Polk County Health Department Communicable Disease team at 286-3890. They will talk through with the provider the same things…if there are any alternatives, medically stable and a positive test. Then the Health Department will work with the shelter on how to transport the person to the shelter. We would like to make sure providers send the patient with appropriate medications.Why isn’t more explanation being given to what we consider underlying conditions in our county and state? Also at what age does elderly begin?COVID-19 is a new disease that we have limited and evolving information regarding the risk factors. The CDC considers elderly people 65 years and older and people of any age who have an underlying health condition that may be at greater risk for severity and illness with COVID-19.

We are seeing reference labs that are starting to utilize this. Healthcare providers have some access to it. We are awaiting if local health departments will be able to access this type of testing through the state. There has been some limited testing we’ve heard for antibodies with some of the mass testing through the businesses. This is evolving and emerging.What is the status of housing and evictions for low-income individuals?On March 20, 2020, the Governor added to her proclamation that no one should be evicted from their residence at this time. If you are hearing of people being evicted, please reach out to the Governor’s Constituent Line at (515) 281-5211. The Polk County Sherriff’s office is not evicting anyone.Can you address whether cities should cancel or modify 4th of July events?This is something we are continuing to monitor the situation, what the Governor is sharing with in terms of plans for Iowa and county by county. We are trying to look at what this guidance looks like if counties or communities shouldn’t open up per the Governor or if they would.What was the number of calls to 211?13,949 211 calls from Polk County residents during 3/8-5/2/2020.Do the 33 long-term care facilities being monitored with no outbreak, all have at least one positive case?Yes, at least one positive case.Is there any recommendation on isolation for those who have come in contact with someone who has tested positive, but have no symptoms?The guidance continues to be to self-isolate for 14 days if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Monitor for symptoms during that 14-day period.What are the recommendations for those who have an “inconclusive” test result?If someone has an inconclusive test result, they should work with their provider and the lab for any retesting protocols.                                                                                                                                                                     According to a New York Times Article Yesterday, Des Moines has the 4th "highest average daily growth of cases of metropolitan communities in the country.  It lists the daily growth rate at 15%.  It places Des Moines on a "watch list," so to speak.  Are you bracing for a surge, especially in light of plans to continue to reopen the state?We have been planning for a potential surge since the beginning of the pandemic and that has been the work of our Medical Coordination Center. They have put together strong plans to be able to respond to that. We continue to monitor the situation and monitor the status of our hospitals on a daily basis. So this is something we have been planning for in case it should happen.If an organization is aware that an employee has a positive COVID-19 test does the state and local public health do the contact tracing or is the organization responsible? Do employees have to notify their employer of a positive test?The Iowa Department of Public Health for the contact investigation and contact tracing for the positive COVID-19 tests, individuals and cases in Polk County. We encourage employers to take a look at where a positive employee might be, who they may have come in contact with and taking action in terms of cleaning and following guidance that we have on our website to address the positive case.

People are having a difficult time finding materials to make homemade gowns.Any guidance on summer camps and how those will open given the governors comments yesterday?In regards to summer camps, we need to continue to monitor and see what the Governor providers in terms of her guidance for the state and plan for different eventualitiesWhat plans are you referring to when you said you "We have been planning for a surge... and getting ready to activate those plans.”There are a series of interrelations plans starting with individual hospitals. Individual hospitals on how to allocate the resources they have – staff, and beds. As they need to depend upon other health facilities either within their health system, they can move patients, allocate resources accordingly. As it escalates up between health systems, the hospitals in the metro can work together to distribute patients that best matches the resources available. Then you can move up one step further to a regional surge plan, this would be across the 27 counties that are included in the service area 1A, 1B and 1C. All of those hospitals working together to identify available beds, staff and logistics in a way that makes the most sense to match up the level of care with the resources available. That might me releasing patients or moving patients from a higher level of care to a critical access hospital.PCHD had been doing some contact tracing. Has that all now switched to state contact tracing?  How many currently being traced?The state assumed case contact and contact tracing. There are approximately 1,000 people that are currently being under investigation and contact tracing in process.   And to clarify again - you're preparing to activate those plans?  And if so, when do you anticipate doing so?The plans are prepared as a contingency. Each day the balance and demand of those resources to continue to change. It is a very dynamic process.

Testing is occurring at Test Iowa is different than their providers, reference labs and state hygienic lab.What type of testing has been done at the long term care facilities with a confirmed case but no outbreak? Have all residents been tested? Are we waiting on test results?Testing has been done based on contact tracing among residents and staff. This work has been done closely with the facility and our staff.I remain all too aware of the number of people being refused tests despite having known contact with positive individuals, including a health care worker whose spouse and work colleagues can't get tests, or having significant symptoms and basically being verbally confirmed but told at the Unity Point respiratory clinic that they can't be referred for testing as they are not a health care worker. Could we have some straight talk about how testing is being allocated and how the numbers of "presumed positive" but no testing allowed are being handled? These specific examples are all in Polk County.Testing in Polk County is a little complicated unfortunately. Testing is only more available if you consider Test Iowa more available. Testing is not more available at the healthcare facilities. There is still a shortage and we still have to follow IDPH guidelines if you are using the state hygienic lab and those guidelines are fairly strict. Asymptomatic people would not qualify. You need to have symptoms of COVID-19 to qualify for testing.  Testing guidelines is available on Iowa Department of Public Health’s website. The doctor looks at CDC guidelines and ultimately it is up to the doctor if they want to test you for COVID-19. We have to keep in consideration testing is used for the sickest of the sick. Testing is truly not readily available.A new report shows an increase in cases of more than 70% in Polk County in the last week.  The report calls Polk County/Des Moines one of the top 10 hot spots in the country.  The Governor is expected to announce today further lifting of restrictions in Polk County.  Do you believe this is the time to do so?The information that we shared today is really the prudent way for people to behave. I think that you’re hearing that our businesses are cautious to reopen, we are asking our residents to continue to use the mitigation tactics. Regarding it being the right time, I think what we see in our cases and our hospitalizations, the numbers of COVID-19 in Polk County are still increasing. All the preventative tips we have discussed are still required at this time. Whether a community is allowed to open, we hear the phrase, “just because we can, should we?” We have shared all the up-to-date data that we have so people can make those decisions appropriately.Is the recommendation to check on positive COVID-19 friends/family about the sudden/increased risk of death at home OR about community resources (tracking/follow-up) being overwhelmed?I think there are several reasons for making this recommendation. With COVID-19, we are encouraging people to self-isolate, to stay home to prevent the transmission of this virus and this is putting some distance between people. It is decreasing the opportunity to do things that we normally do in terms of checking on our loves ones. We are stressing the importance of checking on people when we are navigating a time where people are isolating and social distancing to make sure people are doing okay. As numbers of people who are ill with COVID-19 increase, this is a way for all of us to come together especially our more vulnerable populations. We make this recommendation during extreme heat. We need to be checking on others, clients to make sure people are doing okay. This is not an unusual recommendation that we would make.Can you elaborate on the guidance you will be pushing out to long-term care facilities regarding supplies/PPE? We have a list of questions for the vendor vetting process. Those questions will get pushed out as well as guidance to determine if your supply chain is fully function or not. We will also be putting out some guidance what PPE you should have on hand and what quantities. This will vary greatly from facility to facility.Can you clarify whether there is Polk County specific business recovery guidance and where that info can be found?  Or should we still be using the IDPH guidance?  Has IDPH updated guidance since their 4/27 release and if so, where that information can be found?Polk County Guidance can be found here: https://www.polkcountyiowa.gov/media/d1fc4wa0/brp-05082020.pdfI like the Strike Teams.  Any update on efforts to lessen the time between when the tests are given and people receive their results?  Many I've seen have been about a week delay for results.A lot of it has to do with the number of tests that a lab has to process at any given time.How many people are on the strike team? What tests are being used? Where are tests processed? Is it aimed at long-term care only or other businesses also? How is the team assigned?Strike teams used for special situations such as a smaller facility that won’t qualify for a state strike team. This organization or business could be at the start of an outbreak or it could be working with a high risk population. We do this like we do in public health if it were for vaccinations or disease testing. Going forward, we will continue to look at this by a case-by-case basis in terms what the need is and what kind of staffing it would take to execute testing.So Test Iowa and hygienic lab running essentially separate processes out of the same lab facility? And little coordination/collaboration?That would be a question directed at state hygienic lab regarding how they are handling al the testing and specimens they are currently testing.Since testing has become more available, do these positives include asymptomatic individuals who qualified to be tested?We are aware there are people who have been tested who are asymptomatic.

And little coordination/collaboration?That would be a question directed at state hygienic lab regarding how they are handling al the testing and specimens they are currently testing.Last week there was an article on channel 5 website that Polk County found a vendor and was looking into purchasing its own testing. What happened with this? Is this still being looked at? Is the criteria to get a test being expanded?One of the challenging things as a county is you would like some control over your destiny knowing that Test Iowa is taking a board approach to testing over the test. One of the areas we are exploring is strategic testing and putting in place a model that will serve our community to prevent widespread COVId-19 transmission or a second wave if it was going to occur. That will require additional testing and a system set up to actually to do something with the data once it happens. We are exploring those options at this point and we are in discussion with some Iowa based companies that have the capacity to help us. We feel quite certain we will have guidance to report on in the future. At this point, it is fair to knowledge that we are exploring it fully. It takes thoughtful and meaningful work to set up and make sure it is used effectively.LTC outbreak # quite different from state’s website (Polk 24 vs state 7)—is state only reporting those >10% affected?The Iowa Department of Public Health is reporting long term care facilities with outbreak on their website. Polk County Health Department is following any facility that has a case whether it is long term care, assisted living, or a group home. Our numbers include all of the above. That is the difference between Iowa Department of Public Health and Polk County Health Department numbers.Is there a virtual place where county public health boards and emergency response teams are sharing local best practices? I think Dubuque County could take a lesson from what you are doing here. We are also building our own testing capacity outside the state government approval process.  No knight in shining armor is going to be riding to our rescue.What we do at Polk County Emergency Management and at Polk County Health Department is along the way we have been documenting best practices. We meet with staff about best practices and areas for improvement. So much as has happened over the past couple of months. It is important to capture those practices along the way. We suggest everyone do this as the COVID-19 response keeps happening. There is no formal process at the local level. At the state level, there will be more likely a state after action plan.Within the Medical Coordination Center, we have the Central Iowa EMS directors websites. www.ciems.org. All of their documentation for EMS is on their website and it includes best practices with COVID-19.Is there a process in place for facilitating employee antibody testing for businesses in Polk County?Currently, Iowa Department of Public Health is doing antibody testing in conjunction with PRC testing. At this time, antibody testing being done individually to make decisions about isolation or release from isolation is not occurring at this time. Antibody testing is emerging and as well learn more about it, we will expand its utility and how we will use it. Stay tuned, we will provide more information as it becomes available.The county has guidance on reopening business. Who can we talk to about how this document to be used for our operations. Specifically, it says basketball courts and racquetball courts should be closed. is this a recommendation or a requirement? We have been sending those specific questions to the State of Iowa. We are happy to do that and we can get back to you about that once we get that answer.Can the county help business Identify vendors for business to purchase their own test for the workforce since it is unlikely the state will facilitate additional testing for return to work or students coming back to campuses in the fall?At this time, there are certain lab vendors that our hospital systems have worked with. We are not sure of the vendors that may be available. We can take a look at this through logistics. We would caution everyone about scams. There are a lot people reaching out and claiming they have tests available for organizations to purchase. If you receive one of those emails and want us to look at it, please email us at logistics@polkcountyiowa.gov. We will take a look at it and see what we can do to help. As testing becomes more available, we suggest working through your occupational health contractor or your health system is the safest route for any business to go through in our community.You had indicated on previous call that state took over contact tracing for Polk. Do we know how many monitored, how many people doing the work of tracing, and where we can get info from the state on this?Any new cases that were received, notified or reported would be followed by the state since April 24th. If you look at Iowa Department of Public Health’s website and monitor new cases we have, that’s where numbers can be seen. The increases in new cases received reflected on that website would be cases followed by Iowa Department of Public Health. I would contact Iowa Department of Public Health if you want more information about case implementation and contact tracing.Resilience webinars—are the 2 dates the same material or wk. 2 building on wk.1?The material will be the same for both webinars. We will continue to push out new topics throughout the summer.To what extent is contact tracing being completed?  We have had multiple employees with different scenarios stating their spouse or live-in family members have tested positive.  One employee had close contact with a family member not living with him and wasn't contacted by anyone.  Another employee said the daycare her kids go to had a confirmed positive case and she wasn't notified or contacted by anyone.  Some employees still report to work and are turned away at the checkpoints.Questions about variances in contact tracing, I would encourage you to reach out to Iowa Department of Public Health and get some clarification on the difference between those cases and how they are handled.In regards to a child care facility, please reach out to our communicable disease team at (515) 286-3890 to share some information and concerns. Our team is happy to look into that issue.Do health officials think second wave is actually fall or likely summer given reopening too soon?I wish we knew. We are monitoring the situation and we continue to monitor our numbers daily. I would say one of the concerns we have with a fall second wave is the simultaneous emergence of seasonal influenza on top of COVID-19. If we can give you one practical tip to protect yourself and your family is to get your seasonal flu shot. We will continue to monitor the emergence of a second wave.   Last week there was an article on channel 5 website that Polk County found a vendor and was looking into purchasing its own testing.

However, they are not currently being provided at the day care my granddaughters attend, which has closed two of their rooms for fourteen days due to a child in each testing positive. The day care is begging parents to distance as they say they can't afford to stay open if they have to keep closing rooms.

Anyone who is in question if they have been exposed, these are important guidelines to follow. With more availability of testing, that is another avenue to determine if they have COVID-19 and to follow proper guidance in regards to staying home. It is also important to call your healthcare provider and talk to them about symptoms and guidance they may have for you.Has PCHD resumed giving routine school age vaccines?We have resumed our childhood vaccines.

We continue to share that guidance and support the use of these items within congregate living. Do we know what effects the ongoing protests will have on COVID-19 case numbers? What precautions should protestors take to stay safe? Sorry again if this was already talked about. Anytime we see people getting together in large numbers and being in close proximity, we have concerns that we could see the number of cases increase. We continue to echo in regards to any group activity, the importance of staying home when sick. We know particularly people want to come together to share their stories and messages and if they are ill, maybe take to social media to prevent the spread of illness.  Wear masks, use hand sanitizer, maintain social distancing whenever possible. All of this is so important anytime anyone is out in groups.   Friday's situation report implied some contact tracing being done by Polk Co. again.  Has Polk Co. resumed doing contact tracing for all or just some?Iowa Department of Public Health continues to do individual contacts and case tracing. Polk County Health Department is working with congregate living in terms on contact tracing, testing and providing support. With high school athletics restarting, are there any special steps being taken to provide timely support if + cases/exposure arise? There is guidance available for high school athletic and sporting events. We encourage the use of that guidance. We continue to do what we do in terms of identifying positive cases and notifying contacts. All of those processes are in place whether at state or local level and they aid in identifying individuals and reducing spread whether it’s at an athletic event, group event or other activities. What is the situation at the Polk County jail, and what is the effect of the influx of people being arrested at protests? Are they at risk of catching the virus at the jail?Those who have been detained as a part of the protests are quickly processed and released. There is minimal exposure. There are isolation areas in the jail for those who disclose COVID-19 positive status or are tested positive while at the jail. What is the current testing situation in Polk?  Is it easy to get upon request (symptoms or no symptoms) or do there continue to be issues with availability? As of right now, the clinics and hospitals still have a tight prioritization list of how they are testing people. Test Iowa is still available for asymptomatic people. The situation remains very fluid and will continue to do so for quite a while. What we are hearing from Test Iowa is that people can schedule out 3 days from the day they schedule their appointment. The testing may not be immediate but it should be within 3 days when you try to schedule.

That is a private business/sector decision. It is also a legislative decision. It is beyond what public health or emergency management can do.Is there any new advice or updates about safety of swimming pools?  There is nothing new.

Referencing the Phases from the CDC determining when we can advance, for example larger group sizes.Our governor provides that guidance with regards to reopening and group sizes in Iowa.Recommendations from the CDC for Covid 19 positive individuals that are Asymptomatic is the 10 days from onset & 72 hours symptom free ALONG with 2 Negative test > or = 24 hours apart to ensure individuals do not still carry the virus.  Some local clinics and hospitals are not doing this or providing documentation employees can return to work.  As an employer, how can we ensure that employee is recovered and no longer has a potential to infect other employees?  OSHA also states that employers shall follow CDC guidelines and in return those guidelines are not being met by local care facilities.The CDC offers two different strategies in regards to when a person can return to activities and work. The test based strategy is one that is offered and that one is suggested to be employed based on conditions in your community with regards to the degree of illness and the availability of testing.The other strategy is to use the 10/R/3 strategy.In relation to illness guidelines, how do we help people triage whether a symptom is truly covid or not likely covid?  Examples:  nausea and diarrhea—return 24hrs after resolved, 72hrs after resolved, 10 days since onset + 72hrs resolved?  Or does answer depend on community transmission level, amt of exposure in community, etc. Do we say even 1 symptom counts as possible covid or say it has to be more than 1 or does it depend on symptom (e.g. loss of smell counts but headache is wait and see)? Hard questions to answer but especially given asymptomatic folks, these are the types of questions employers are being asked to answer daily and schools will be in same boat.If you are ill, the important thing is to self-isolate whether it is COVID-19 or something type of illness. Continue to monitor and watch for symptoms of COVID-19. Most importantly seeking the guidance and counsel of your health care provider. If you do not have one, guidance from public health to make some type of determination about what you are dealing regarding an illness and what types of testing are needed based on your symptoms.Last day to place supply orders through PCEMA is July 7.

Our team is starting the process for this.Are there data show more serious outcomes locally from strokes, heart attacks, etc.?They are just seeing an uptick in cases or the equity of patients in the EMS field.What Phase is Polk County in?  How is this determined?  Can you review that process? Referencing the Phases from the CDC determining when we can advance, for example larger group sizes.Our governor provides that guidance with regards to reopening and group sizes in Iowa.Recommendations from the CDC for Covid 19 positive individuals that are Asymptomatic is the 10 days from onset & 72 hours symptom free ALONG with 2 Negative test > or = 24 hours apart to ensure individuals do not still carry the virus.  Some local clinics and hospitals are not doing this or providing documentation employees can return to work.  As an employer, how can we ensure that employee is recovered and no longer has a potential to infect other employees?  OSHA also states that employers shall follow CDC guidelines and in return those guidelines are not being met by local care facilities.The CDC offers two different strategies in regards to when a person can return to activities and work. The test based strategy is one that is offered and that one is suggested to be employed based on conditions in your community with regards to the degree of illness and the availability of testing.The other strategy is to use the 10/R/3 strategy.In relation to illness guidelines, how do we help people triage whether a symptom is truly covid or not likely covid?  Examples:  nausea and diarrhea—return 24hrs after resolved, 72hrs after resolved, 10 days since onset + 72hrs resolved?  Or does answer depend on community transmission level, amt of exposure in community, etc. Do we say even 1 symptom counts as possible covid or say it has to be more than 1 or does it depend on symptom (e.g. loss of smell counts but headache is wait and see)? Hard questions to answer but especially given asymptomatic folks, these are the types of questions employers are being asked to answer daily and schools will be in same boat.If you are ill, the important thing is to self-isolate whether it is COVID-19 or something type of illness. Continue to monitor and watch for symptoms of COVID-19. Most importantly seeking the guidance and counsel of your health care provider. If you do not have one, guidance from public health to make some type of determination about what you are dealing regarding an illness and what types of testing are needed based on your symptoms.Last day to place supply orders through PCEMA is July 7.

Please consider lifting those restrictions that require employees to have a doctor's excuse for illness.  The clinicians are currently inundated with serious illnesses, COVID-19 tests for those showing symptoms of the illness and other issues.  They will not be able to take the time to write a note for your employee.  Also you do not want your employee visiting a clinic where people displaying symptoms of COVID-19 have gone to get tested. If you have employees that have pre-existing conditions making them susceptible to serious consequences from contracting COVID-19, we are asking you to make every effort to allow them to work from home or allow them to take sick time to remain safe during this crisis. There are some preventative measures that can be taken to help keep you and your employees safe.  Consider having your employees take their temperature before they come to work and when they get home from work.  Any temperature over 100.4 degrees should be reported to a supervisor and that employee should stay home.  Consider increasing cleaning of work surfaces at your facilities.  Cleaning should take place frequently throughout the day.  Any commercial cleaner is effective as is a mix of bleach and water. Increase social distancing at your workplace.  Consider allowing work from home where possible.  Limit sharing of equipment and using common workstations, break areas, etc. Finally, if you have an employee that displays any of the symptoms of COVID-19 (persistent cough, fever greater than 100.4, sore throat) they should be sent home immediately and advised to contact their medical provider.  Those in immediate contact with that employee should be considered for self quarantine and observation. COVID-19 Testing Considerations for BusinessesIowa Guidance for Senior Centers and Adult Day ProgramsBest Practices tips for greenhouses and nurseries from Illinois Green Industry AssociationTips to prevent COVID-19 at greenhouses and nurseries from Michigan State UniversityImplementation of Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 TransmissionUSDA COVID-19 Federal Rural Resource Guide OSHA’s Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19IDPH Resources CDC ResourcesCDC Resources for Businesses and EmployersCOVID-19 Cleaning ProductsInitiating Planning SectionTelework GuidanceContinuity of Operations GuidanceActions for Infrastructure Protection and Supply Chains during COVID-19Business Continuity Planning Guidance

Donors should also take their temperature before reporting to their appointment. A donor with a temperature of 99.5 or higher should reschedule. See a full list of our COVID-19 precautions here.People who live in Iowa, Nebraska, or South Dakota who were diagnosed with COVID-19 who have now recovered may be eligible to help patients currently battling this illness! If you had COVID-19, your body may be producing specific COVID-19 antibodies. What does this mean? By donating plasma, which contains proteins in the form of antibodies, you may be helping to provide treatment for current and future COVID-19 patients. This is currently being studied in a trial as part of the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project. If you never received a positive test result for COVID-19 but your physician diagnosed you for COVID-19 or you have had symptoms indicatives of COVID-19 and you have since fully recovered, you may be eligible for antibody testing to determine whether you’re a candidate for a convalescent plasma donation.

For the 83,673 cases of COVID-19 among healthcare personnel, death status was only available for 53,902 (64.4%).CDC has moved the following information to the Previous U.S. COVID-19 Case Data page.Updated DailyThis page is updated daily based on data confirmed at 4:00pm ET the day before. Reported by Jurisdiction’s Health DepartmentData on this page are reported voluntarily to CDC by each jurisdiction’s health department. CDC encourages all jurisdictions to report the most complete and accurate information that best represents the current status of the pandemic in their jurisdiction. Number of JurisdictionsThere are currently 56 U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions reporting cases of COVID-19. This includes 50 states, District of Columbia, Guam, New York City, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S Virgin Islands. New York State’s case and death counts do not include New York City’s counts as they are separate jurisdictions. Confirmed & Probable CountsAs of April 14, 2020, CDC case counts and death counts include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths. This change was made to reflect an interim COVID-19 position statement pdf iconexternal iconissued by the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020. The position statement included a case definition and made COVID-19 a nationally notifiable disease. Nationally notifiable disease cases are voluntarily reported to CDC by jurisdictions.A confirmed case or death is defined by meeting confirmatory laboratory evidence for COVID-19.A probable case or death is defined by one of the following:Not all jurisdictions report confirmed and probable cases and deaths to CDC. When not available to CDC, it is noted as N/A. Accuracy of DataCDC does not know the exact number of COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths for a variety of reasons. COVID-19 can cause mild illness, symptoms might not appear immediately, there are delays in reporting and testing, not everyone who is infected gets tested or seeks medical care, and there may be differences in how jurisdictions confirm numbers. Changes & Fluctuations in DataHealth departments may update case data over time when they receive more complete and accurate information.The number of new cases reported each day fluctuates. There is generally less reporting on the weekends and holidays. Differences between CDC and Jurisdiction DataIf the number of cases or deaths reported by CDC is different from the number reported by jurisdiction health departments, data reported by jurisdictions should be considered the most up to date. The differences may be due to the timing of the reporting and website updates.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Call at 8:00 am for same day appointment Monday through FridayWe now offer self-collected STD tests!Individuals who do not have symptoms or been named a contact can come to the Health Department for a “walk-in” STD/HIV test without seeing a nurse. Visits generally around taking about 30 minutes (the HIV test is 20-25 minutes itself), but depends on the number of visits the lab has at that time.If you don’t have symptoms or have been named a contact, the individual will fill out their own risk assessment, and then be seen by a laboratory tech. The lab tech will go over their paperwork and be able to recommend what tests the individual would benefit from. In most cases there will be a blood draw (HIV and Syphilis testing), and depending of sexual practices, we will offer a urine STD testing, as well as a throat swab and rectal swab (the urine and rectal swabs are self-collected; the throat swab can be self-collected, but lab personnel can also collect that if the individual prefers).The charge is $10 for in county and $25 for out of county. Most of the time HIV results will be available during that same visit; however sometimes they will need to be sent out, and the individual will get called back in for those results in a few days. All the other testing will have results in a few days. Individuals can walk in Monday through Friday from 8:30 –11:30 AM and 1:00 – 3:00 PM. WE DO NOT TEST ON WEDNESDAYS!

Find pages with...Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19CDC continues to study the spread and effects of the novel coronavirus across the United States.  We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.  This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.  In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.It is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.  CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.  Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.  Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Find pages with...Updated June 22, 2020Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. See People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness.The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website.​At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online. See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.Visit the How to Protect Yourself & Others page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.Wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.While people who are sick or know that they have COVID-19 should isolate at home, COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That’s why it’s important for everyone to practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear cloth face coverings in public settings. Cloth face coverings provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people.The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.  Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.More information about cloth face coverings can be found on our cloth face coverings site.For more information, see Groups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness.There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.Find more information about how coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself.Visit CDC’s contact lens website for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care.Find more information about how coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself.Visit CDC’s contact lens website for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care.Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. However, a few children have developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Currently, information about this syndrome is limited. CDC is working with state and local health departments to learn more about MIS-C.You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at How to Protect Yourself & Others. Additional information on how COVID-19 is spread is available at How COVID-19 Spreads.More information on Keeping Children Healthy during the COVID-19 Outbreak is available online.No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. COVID-19 can look different in different people. For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the flu. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems.CDC and partners are investigating cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. Learn more about COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. When you talk with your child, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. Talk to your children about COVID-19 and help them cope with stress.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. We do not yet know what causes MIS-C. However, we know that many children with MIS-C had the virus that causes COVID-19, or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS-C can be serious, even deadly, but most children who were diagnosed with this condition have gotten better with medical care.Contact your child’s doctor, nurse, or clinic right away if your child is showing symptoms of MIS-C. Seek emergency care right away if your child is showing any of these emergency warning signs of MIS-C or other concerning signs.No. The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk.For more information, see Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in Children.For more information, see Help Children Learn at Home.Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.For more information, see Keep Children Healthy during the COVID-19 Outbreak.Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.It’s not known yet whether all children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk. CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.Additional information on caring for children and on child development specific conditions are available.Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations. You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your family’s situation. It is important to continue your family’s coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911. If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.Notify your child’s healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.If your child’s healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same. These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the school’s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.  If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See CDC’s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product. Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon. Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below:Protect yourself and others.Put your household plan into action.Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses. CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities. These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  “stay at home” or “shelter in place.” What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities. These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.Please contact your local health department to find out more.CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you. Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department. Local decisions depend on local circumstances.People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.Read more about COVID-19 Symptoms.When to Seek Emergency Medical AttentionLook for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.Yes. It is possible to test positive for flu (as well as other respiratory infections) and COVID-19 at the same time.Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.You can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. See Test for Past Infection for more information.Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: viral tests and antibody tests. A viral test checks for a current infection. An antibody test checks for a previous infection.If you think you need a viral test, call your healthcare provider or state or localexternal icon health department and tell them about your symptoms and how you think you may have been exposed to the virus. Your healthcare provider can let you know if they offer viral tests at their office. Your state or local health department can provide local information on where testing is available. See Testing for Current Infection for more information.If you want an antibody test, call your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one. You can also visit your state or local health department’s website for local information on antibody testing.Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others. See Testing for Current Infection for more information.Viral tests are used to diagnose COVID-19. These tests tell you if you currently have an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. There are many viral tests available. All of the viral tests identify the virus in respiratory samples, such as from swabs from the inside of your nose.Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the laboratory receives your samples. Two tests allow you to collect your sample at home – either a swab from the inside of your nose or a saliva sample – but you will still need to send the sample to a laboratory for processing.Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested). Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses. You can find a patient information sheet about each test on FDA’s websiteexternal icon.Antibody testing checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. When someone gets COVID-19, their body usually makes antibodies. However, it typically takes one to three weeks to develop these antibodies. Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop antibodies. A positive result from this test may mean that person was previously infected with the virus. Talk to your healthcare provider about what your antibody test result means.Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose COVID-19. To see if you are currently infected, you need a viral test. Viral tests identify the virus in respiratory samples, such as swabs from the inside of your nose.We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 can protect someone from getting infected again or, if they do, how long this protection might last. Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.We do not know yet if people who recover from COVID-19 can get infected again. CDC and partners are investigating to determine if a person can get sick with COVID-19 more than once. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.This list is based on:As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible. Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more. People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your body’s function.  You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.  Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.Contact tracing is used by health departments to prevent the spread of infectious disease. In general, contact tracing involves identifying people who have an infectious disease (cases) and their contacts (people who may have been exposed) and working with them to interrupt disease transmission. For COVID-19, this includes asking cases to isolate and contacts to quarantine at home voluntarily.Contact tracing for COVID-19 typically involvesTo prevent the further spread of disease, COVID-19 contacts are encouraged to stay home and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others until 14 days after their last exposure to a person with COVID-19. Contacts should monitor themselves by checking their temperature twice daily and watching for symptoms of COVID-19.Generally, contact tracing includes the following steps:For COVID-19, a close contact is defined as anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 48 hours before the person began feeling sick until the time the patient was isolated.If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, a case investigator from the health department may call you to check-in on your health, discuss who you’ve been in contact with, and ask where you spent time while you may have been infectious and able to spread COVID-19 to others. You will also be asked to stay at home and self-isolate, if you are not doing so already.Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face.If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, a contact tracer from the health department might contact you to inform you that you’ve been exposed to COVID-19.You should stay at home and self-quarantine for 14 days, starting from the last day you were possibly exposed to COVID-19. The contact tracer will help identify the dates of your self-quarantine. The contact tracer can also provide resources about COVID-19 testing in your area.You should take your temperature twice a day, watch for symptoms of COVID-19, and notify your health department if you develop symptoms. You should also notify people you had close contact with recently if you become ill, so they can monitor their health. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face.Yes, you are still considered a close contact even if you were wearing a cloth face covering while you were around someone with COVID-19. Cloth face coverings are meant to prevent someone from transmitting the disease to others, and not to protect someone from becoming infected.Discussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider.Your name will not be revealed to those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify your close contacts that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. How data are collected, stored, and shared are specific to each state or jurisdiction.If you have been around someone who was identified as a close contact to a person with COVID-19, you should closely monitor yourself for any symptoms of COVID-19. You do not need to self-quarantine.There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19.COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturer’s label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Additional information on how to safely conduct aerosol-generating procedures is in the CDC’s Postmortem Guidance. Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time).After cleaning and removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.The belongings of someone who has died of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 outside their home (for example, in a hospital setting) may be returned to family members along with instructions for cleaning and disinfection. Depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility.Family members should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling these items. Depending on the belongings received, family members should also follow the household item-specific cleaning and disinfection guidelines for personal items, such as electronics.When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased person’s next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of State’s Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:Please see CDC’s guidance for additional information.CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response. This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. CDC works 24/7 to protect people’s health. More information about CDC’s response to COVID-19 is available online.Cleaning with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. If vacuuming is necessary or required in a school, business, or community facility that was used by a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, first follow the CDC recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical.After cleaning and disinfection, the following recommendations may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming:Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. Cleaning removes dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface.Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces.Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used.Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i.e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Once the area has been appropriately disinfected, it can be opened for use. Workers without close contact with the person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed.The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identified on List Nexternal icon against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19.Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e.g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e.g., mulch, sand) is not recommended.CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective on these surfaces.At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.  A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.No. At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, includingIf you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19. A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.Walking your dog is important for both animal and human health and wellbeing. Walk dogs on a leash, and stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. Do not gather in groups, stay out of crowded places, and avoid mass gatherings. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.See “Can I take my dog to a dog park?” for information on dog parks.Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread it to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather.Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park.See more information on pets and COVID-19 and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe.Until we know more about how this virus affects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather.Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. If you must take your pet to a groomer or boarding facility, follow any protocols put into place at the facility, such as wearing a cloth face covering and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible.Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). Use an EPA-registered disinfectantexternal icon to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use.Do not put face coverings on pets, and do not take a sick pet to a groomer or boarding facility. Signs of sickness in animals may include:If you think your pet is sick, call your veterinarian. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.See more information on pets and COVID-19 and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe.There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances. Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis. For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animal’s veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19.Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19.Talk to a veterinarian if a pet in your facility gets sick or if you have any concerns about the health of any pets in the facility. If you think a pet in the facility was exposed to or is showing signs consistent with COVID-19, contact your state health official to discuss guidance on testing pets or other animals for the virus that causes COVID-19.People who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid providing care for sick pets, if possible.For more information, visit CDC’s If You Have Pets webpage.CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.Please refer to CDC’s requirements for bringing a dog to the United States. The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game.  Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations:You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at your facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility.For more information, see Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon and Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).See also: Pets and Other AnimalsCommunity mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Community mitigation is especially important before a vaccine or drug becomes widely available.Some community mitigation actions may include:Individuals, communities, schools, businesses and healthcare organizations all have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies.Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be impacted need to be considered, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness, and those who might be more impacted socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation.Putting mitigation into practice is based on:*CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department. Local decisions depend on local circumstances.The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Additionally, proper operation of these aquatic venues and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus.While there is ongoing community spread of the virus, it is important for individuals, as well as operators of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds (for example, at hotels or apartment complexes or owned by communities) to take steps to ensure health and safety:The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. Researchers do not know whether this virus can cause disease if a person is exposed to untreated wastewater or sewerage systems. There is no evidence to date that this has occurred. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low.Recently, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater.Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. These standard practices can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.In most cases, it is safe to wash your hands with soap and tap water during a Boil Water Advisory. Follow the guidance from your local public health officials. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.1Fever may be subjective or confirmed2Close contact is defined as—a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case– or –b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met”See CDC’s updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Find pages with...Plan, Prepare and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 Below are changes as of May 6, 2020More ChangesPDF Downloadpdf iconThis interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The outbreak first started in China, but the virus continues to spread internationally and in the United States. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other characteristics of COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. Updates are available on CDC’s web page at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/. CDC will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available.This interim guidance may help prevent workplace exposures to COVID-19 in non-healthcare settings (separate guidance is available for healthcare settings). CDC has also provided guidance for critical infrastructure workers who may have had exposure to a person known or suspected to have COVID-19. Unless otherwise specified, this interim guidance for businesses and employers applies to critical infrastructure workplaces as well.Businesses and employers can prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 within the workplace. Employers should respond in a way that takes into account the level of disease transmission in their communities and revise their business response plans as needed. Employers should follow the White House Guidelines for Opening Up America Againexternal icon, a phased approach based on current levels of transmission and healthcare capacity at the state or local level, as part of resuming business operations. Business operation decisions should be based on both the level of disease transmission in the community and your readiness to protect the safety and health of your employees and customers.Businesses and employers are encouraged to coordinate with stateexternal icon and localexternal icon health officials to obtain timely and accurate information to inform appropriate responses. Local conditions will influence the decisions that public health officials make regarding community-level strategies. CDC has guidance for mitigation strategiespdf icon according to the level of community transmission or impact of COVID-19.As an employer, if your business operations were interrupted, resuming normal or phased activities presents an opportunity to update your COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plans. All employers should implement and update as necessary a plan that:Talk with your employees about planned changes and seek their input. Additionally, collaborate with employees and unions to effectively communicate important COVID-19 information.See the OSHA COVID-19 guidancepdf iconexternal icon for more information on how to protect workers from potential exposures, according to their exposure risk. Plans should consider that employees may be able to spread COVID-19 even if they do not show symptoms.All employers need to consider how best to decrease the spread of COVID-19 and lower the impact in your workplace. This should include activities to:Monitor federal, state, and local public health communications about COVID-19 regulations, guidance, and recommendations and ensure that workers have access to that information. Frequently check the CDC COVID-19 website.Actively encourage sick employees to stay home:Consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees before they enter the facility, in accordance with state and local public health authorities and, if available, your occupational health services:Identify where and how workers might be exposed to COVID-19 at work. Employers are responsible for providing a safe and healthy workplaceexternal icon. Conduct a thorough hazard assessmentexternal icon of the workplace to identify potential workplace hazards related to COVID-19. Use appropriate combinations of controls from the hierarchy of controls to limit the spread of COVID-19, including engineering controls, workplace administrative policies, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect workers from the identified hazards (see table below):Separate sick employees:Take action if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection:In most cases, you do not need to shut down your facility. If it has been less than 7 days since the sick employee has been in the facility, close off any areas used for prolonged periods of time by the sick person:If it has been 7 days or more since the sick employee used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routinely cleaning and disinfecting all high-touch surfaces in the facility.Follow the CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations:Determine which employees may have been exposed to the virus and may need to take additional precautions:Educate employees about steps they can take to protect themselves at work and at home:For employees who commute to work using public transportation or ride sharing, consider offering the following support:Identify a workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 issues and their impact at the workplace.Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices:Protect employees at higher risk for severe illness through supportive policies and practices. Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Communicate supportive workplace polices clearly, frequently, and via multiple methods. Employers may need to communicate with non-English speakers in their preferred languages.Assess your essential functions and the reliance that others and the community have on your services or products.Determine how you will operate if absenteeism spikes from increases in sick employees, those who stay home to care for sick family members, and those who must stay home to watch their children until childcare programs and K-12 schools resume.Establish policies and practices for social distancing. Alter your workspace to help workers and customers maintain social distancing and physically separate employees from each other and from customers, when possible. Here are some strategies that businesses can use:If you have more than one business location, consider giving local managers the authority to take appropriate actions outlined in their COVID-19 response plans based on their local conditions.Since COVID-19 may be spread by those with no symptoms, businesses and employers should evaluate and institute controls according to the hierarchy of controls to protect their employees and members of the general public.Consider improving the engineering controls using the building ventilation system. This may include some or all of the following activities:Note: Some of the above recommendations are based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review these ASHRAE guidelines for further information on ventilation recommendations.Ensure the safety of your building water system and devices after a prolonged shutdown:Give employees, customers, and visitors what they need to clean their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes:Perform routine cleaning:Perform enhanced cleaning and disinfection after persons suspected/confirmed to have COVID-19 have been in the facility:Limit travel and advise employees if they must travel to take additional precautions and preparations:Minimize risk to employees when planning meetings and gatherings:The table below presents examples of controls to implement in your workplace. The most effective controls are those that rely on engineering solutions, followed by administrative controls, then PPE. PPE is the least effective control method and the most difficult to implement. Worksites may have to implement multiple complementary controls from these columns to effectively control the hazard.Cleaning and DisinfectionTrainingProvide employees with training on:Below are changes as of March 21, 2020To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Find pages with...Plan, Prepare, and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)Printer-friendly version:  pdf icon[239 KB, 10 pages]Revisions were made on 3/12/2020 to reflect the following:This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website periodically for updated interim guidance.Health officials are currently taking steps to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into US communities. Schools play an important role in this effort. Through collaboration and coordination with local health departments, schools should take steps to disseminate information about the disease and its potential transmission within their school community. Schools should prepare to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their students and staff should local health officials identify such a need.Schools should continue to collaborate, share information, and review plans with local health officials to help protect the whole school community, including those with special health needs. School plans should be designed to complement other community mitigation strategies to protect high risk populations and the healthcare system, and minimize disruption to teaching and learning and protect students and staff from social stigma and discrimination. Plans should build on everyday practices (e.g., encouraging hand hygiene, monitoring absenteeism, communicating routinely) that include strategies for before, during, and after a possible outbreak.This interim guidance is intended for administrators of public and private child care programs and K-12 schools. Administrators are individuals who oversee the daily operations of child care programs and K-12 schools, and may include positions like child care program directors, school district superintendents, principals, and assistant principals. This guidance is intended for administrators at both the school/facility and district level.This guidance will help child care programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 within child care and school communities and facilities. It also aims to help child care programs, schools, and partners react quickly should a case be identified. The guidance includes considerations to help administrators plan for the continuity of teaching and learning if there is community spread of COVID-19.Schools, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of diseases to help ensure students have safe and healthy learning environments. Schools serve students, staff, and visitors from throughout the community. All of these people may have close contact in the school setting, often sharing spaces, equipment, and supplies.Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that children with confirmed COVID-19 generally had mild symptoms. Person-to-person spread from or to children, as among adults, is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.  Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of severe illness fromCOVID-19. Despite lower risk of serious illness among most children, children with COVID-19-like symptoms should avoid contact with others who might be at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Schools should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their local communities and for individual exposure events to occur in their facilities, regardless of the level of community transmission, for example a case associated with recent travel to an area with sustained COVID-19 transmission. The following decision tree can be used to help schools determine which set of mitigation strategies may be most appropriate for their current situation.Any school in any community might need to implement short-term closure procedures regardless of community spread if an infected person has been in a school building. If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures regardless of the level of community spread:Coordinate with local health officials. Once learning of a COVID-19 case in someone who has been in the school, immediately notify local health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for their child care programs or schools.Dismiss students and most staff for 2-5 days. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the school. This allows the local health officials to help the school determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.Communicate with staff, parents, and students. Coordinate with local health officials to communicate dismissal decisions and the possible COVID-19 exposure.Clean and disinfect thoroughly.Make decisions about extending the school dismissal. Temporarily dismissing child care programs and K-12 schools is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities.Implement strategies to continue education and related supports for students.The most important thing to do now is plan and prepare. Administrators should reinforce healthy practices among their students and staff. As the global outbreak evolves, schools should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks. Schools need to be ready if COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies:Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs). This should be done in collaboration with local health departmentsexternal icon and other relevant partners. Focus on the components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks.Develop information-sharing systems with partners.Teach and reinforce healthy hygiene practices.Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts.Monitor and plan for absenteeism.Assess group gatherings and events. Consider postponing non-critical gatherings and events. Require sick students and staff to stay home. Establish procedures for students and staff who are sick at school.Create and test communications plans for use with the school community.Review CDC’s guidance for businesses and employers.Child care and K-12 administrators can support their school community by sharing resources with students (if resources are age-appropriate), their families, and staff. Coordinate with local health officials to determine what type of information might be best to share with the school community. Consider sharing the following fact sheets and information sources:For questions about students who plan to travel, or have recently traveled, to areas with community spread of COVID-19, refer to CDC’s FAQ for travelers. Schools can also consult with state and local health officials. Schools may need to postpone or cancel trips that could expose students and staff to potential community spread of COVID-19. Students returning from travel to areas with community spread of COVID-19 must follow guidance they have received from health officials. COVID-19 information for travel is updated regularly on the CDC website.If local health officials report that there are multiple cases of COVID-19 in the community, schools may need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread in the school, but they should continue using the strategies they implemented when there was no community transmission. These additional strategies include:Coordinate with local health officials. This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help a school determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for their specific community’s situation.Implement multiple social distancing strategies. Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs of the school. Not all strategies will be feasible for all schools. For example, limiting hall movement options can be particularly challenging in secondary schools. Many strategies that are feasible in primary or secondary schools may be less feasible in child care settings. Administrators are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between students and limit interactions in large group settings. Schools may consider strategies such as:Consider ways to accommodate the needs of children and families at risk for serious illness from COVID-19. Consider if and how to honor requests of parents who may have concerns about their children attending school due to underlying medical conditions of their children or others in their home.Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use for other viral illnesses, is available in this CDC publicationpdf icon.Additional strategies should be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community in addition to those implemented when there is no, minimal, or moderate transmission. These strategies include:Continue to coordinate with local health officials. If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for child care programs or schools. These strategies are expected to extend across multiple programs, schools, or school districts within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within schools or child care facilities.Consider extended school dismissals. In collaboration with local health officials, implement extended school dismissals (e.g., dismissals for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended school dismissals, also cancel extracurricular group activities, school-based afterschool programs, and large events (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events). Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education (e.g., distance learning) as well as meal programs and other essential services for students.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Find pages with...Plan, Prepare, and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)Printer friendly versionpdf iconRevisions were made on March 18 to reflect the following:Older adults and persons with severe underlying health conditions are at increased risk of more serious illness after contracting COVID-19. Priority should be given to ensuring the safety of these groups of people. See more information on those at increased risk of more serious illness due to COVID-19.This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the following CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.Health officials are currently taking steps to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into US communities. IHE play an important role in this effort. Through collaboration and coordination with local health departments, IHE should take steps to disseminate information about the disease and its potential transmission within their IHE community. IHE should prepare to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their students and staff should local health officials identify community transmission.IHE should continue to collaborate, share information, and review plans with local health officials to help protect the whole IHE community, including those with special health needs. IHE plans should be designed to complement other community mitigation strategies to protect high risk populations and the healthcare system and minimize disruption to teaching and learning and protect students, staff, and faculty from social stigma and discrimination. Plans should build on everyday practices (e.g., encouraging hand hygiene, monitoring absenteeism, communicating routinely) that include strategies for before, during, and after a possible outbreak.This interim guidance is intended for administrators of public and private institutions of higher education (IHE). IHE include a diverse set of American colleges and universities: 2- or 4-year; public, private non-profit, or private for-profit; and comprehensive, research-focused, or special mission. IHE administrators (e.g., presidents, deans, provosts) are individuals who make policies and procedures, set educational aims and standards, and direct programming of institutions of higher education.This guidance will help IHE and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 among students, faculty, and staff. It also aims to help IHE react quickly should a case be identified in the IHE or if there is spread within the community in which the IHE is located.  The guidance includes considerations to help administrators plan for the continuity of teaching, learning, and research if there is community spread of COVID-19 and address concerns related to COVID-19 associated stigma.IHE, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of disease. IHE’s efforts will help ensure students, staff, and faculty have safe and healthy environments in which to learn and work. IHE welcome students, staff, faculty, and visitors from throughout the community. All of these people may have close contact in IHE settings, often sharing spaces, equipment, and supplies.Some individuals are experiencing stigma and discrimination in the United States related to COVID-19. This includes people of Chinese and Asian descent, as well as some returning travelers and emergency responders who may have been exposed to the virus. It is important for IHE to provide accurate and timely information about COVID-19 to students, staff, and faculty to minimize the potential for stigma on college and university campuses. It is also important to provide mental health support to promote resilience among those groups affected by stigma regarding COVID-19. CDC has information IHE can share to reduce COVID-19 associated fear and stigma.IHE should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their local communities and for individual exposure events to occur in facilities, regardless of the level of community transmission, for example, a case associated with travel. The following decision tree can be used to help IHE administrators determine which set of mitigation strategies may be most appropriate for their current situation.Any IHE in any community might need to implement short-term building closure procedures regardless of community spread if an infected person has been on campus. If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures, regardless of level of community spread:Coordinate with local health officials. Once learning of a COVID-19 case in someone who has been on the campus, immediately reach out to local public health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for their IHE.Work with local public health officials to determine cancellation of classes and closure of buildings and facilities. IHE administrators should work closely with their local health officials to determine if a short-term closure (for 2-5 days) of all campus buildings and facilities is needed. In some cases, IHE administrators, working with local health officials, may choose to only close buildings and facilities that had been entered by the individual(s) with COVID-19. This initial short-term class suspension and event and activity (e.g., club meetings; on-campus sport, theater, and music events) cancellation allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the IHE. This allows the local health officials to help the IHE determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.Communicate with students, staff, and faculty. Coordinate with local health officials to communicate dismissal decisions and the possible COVID-19 exposure.Clean and disinfect thoroughly.Make decisions about extending the class suspension and event and activity cancellation. Temporarily suspending classes is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities.Implement strategies to continue education and other related supports for students.The most important thing to do now is plan and prepare. IHE administrators should reinforce healthy practices among their students, staff, and faculty. As the global outbreak evolves, IHE should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks in their communities. IHE need to be ready in the event COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies:Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs). This should be done in collaboration with local public health departments, the IHE’s university system, and other relevant partners. Focus on components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks.Develop information-sharing systems with partners.Reinforce healthy hygiene practices. Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts.Monitor and plan for absenteeism.Assess group gatherings and events. Consider postponing non-critical gatherings and events. Require sick students, staff, and faculty to stay home. Establish procedures for students, staff, and faculty who are sick (with any illness) on campus.Ensure IHE health clinics prepare for COVID-19.Create plans to communicate accurate and timely information to the IHE community.Review CDC’s guidance for businesses and employers.IHE administrators can support their IHE community by sharing COVID-19 informational resources with students, staff, and faculty.  Coordinate with local health officials to determine what type of information is best to share with the IHE community. Consider sharing the following fact sheets and information sources:Information about COVID-19 available through state and localexternal icon health departmentsGeneral fact sheets to help students, staff, faculty, and their families understand COVID-19 and the steps they can take to protect themselves:CDC information for students, staff, and faculty who have recently traveled back to the United States from areas where CDC has identified community spread of COVID-19:For guidance for students, staff, or faculty who plan to travel, or have recently traveled, to areas with community spread of COVID-19, refer to CDC’s FAQ for travelers and COVID-19 travel website. Students returning from travel to areas with community spread of COVID-19 must follow guidance they have received from health officials. For specific guidance on foreign exchange and study abroad programs, see CDC’s guidance on student foreign travel for IHE. IHE can also consult with state and local public health officials. IHE may need to postpone or cancel trips that could expose students and staff to potential community spread of COVID-19.If local health officials report that there are multiple cases in the community, IHE may need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread in the IHE, but they should continue using the strategies they implemented when there was no community transmission. These additional strategies include:Coordinate with local public health officials. This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help an IHE determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for their specific community’s situation.Implement multiple social distancing strategies. Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs on IHE campuses. Not all strategies will be feasible for all IHE. IHE administrators are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between students and limit interactions in large group settings. IHE may consider strategies such as:Consider ways to accommodate the needs of students and staff at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19. Consider if and how to honor requests of students or staff who may have concerns about being on campus due to underlying medical conditions or those of others in their home.Ensure continuity of safe housing.Help counter stigma and promote resilience on campus.Additional strategies should be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community in addition to those implemented when there is no, minimal, or moderate transmission. These strategies include:Continue to coordinate with local public health officials. If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for IHE. Mitigation strategies are expected to extend across organizations (e.g., K-12 schools, business, community and faith-based organizations) within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within IHE.Consider extended in-person class suspension. In collaboration with local public health officials, implement extended class suspension and event/activity cancellations (e.g., suspension/cancellations for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended class suspensions, also cancel extracurricular group activities and large events. Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education, research, and housing as well as meal programs and other essential services for students.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Find pages with...Updated April 2, 2020Audience: These considerations are intended for use by federal, state, and local public health officials, respiratory protection program managers, leaders in occupational health services and infection prevention and control programs, and other leaders in healthcare settings who are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures for preventing pathogen transmission in healthcare settings.Purpose: This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called “N95 respirators”) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare  facilities can refer to COVID-19 preparedness plans. The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities:  Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.Controlling exposures to occupational hazards is a fundamental way to protect personnel. Conventionally, a hierarchy has been used to achieve feasible and effective controls. Multiple control strategies can be implemented concurrently and or sequentially. This hierarchy can be represented as follows:To prevent infectious disease transmission, elimination (physically removing the hazard) and substitution (replacing the hazard) are not typically options for healthcare settings. However, exposures to transmissible respiratory pathogens in healthcare facilities can often be reduced or possibly avoided through engineering and administrative controls and PPE. Prompt detection and effective triage and isolation of potentially infectious patients are essential to prevent unnecessary exposures among patients, healthcare personnel (HCP), and visitors at the facility.N95 respirators are the PPE most often used to control exposures to infections transmitted via the airborne route, though their effectiveness is highly dependent upon proper fit and use. The optimal way to prevent airborne transmission is to use a combination of interventions from across the hierarchy of controls, not just PPE alone. Applying a combination of controls can provide an additional degree of protection, even if one intervention fails or is not available.Respirators, when required to protect HCP from airborne contaminants such as some infectious agents, must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that meets the requirements of OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standardexternal icon. The program should include medical evaluations, training, and fit testing.Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 response. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve N95 respirator supplies along the continuum of care.1Engineering controls reduce exposures for HCP by placing a barrier between the hazard and the HCP. Engineering controls can be very effective as part of a suite of strategies to protect HCP without placing primary responsibility of implementation on them (i.e., they function without HCP having to take an action).Aerosol-generating procedures performed on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients should take place in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). The AIIR should be constructed and maintained in accordance with current guidelines, as recommended in CDC’s COVID-19 interim prevention and control recommendations in healthcare settings. Air from these rooms should be exhausted directly to the outside or be filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter directly before recirculation. Air from these rooms should be exhausted directly to the outside or be filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter directly before recirculation.Barriers such as glass or plastic windows can be an effective solution for reducing exposures among HCP to potentially infectious patients. This approach can be effective in reception areas (e.g., intake desk at emergency department, triage station, information booth, pharmacy drop-off/pick-up windows) where patients may first report upon arrival to a healthcare facility. Other examples include the use of curtains between patients in shared areas and closed suctioning systems for airway suctioning for intubated patients.Another cornerstone of engineering controls are ventilation systems that provide air movement from a clean (HCP workstation or area) to contaminated (sick patient) flow direction (along with appropriate filtration, exchange rate) that are installed and properly maintained.Administrative controls are employer-dictated work practices and policies that reduce or prevent hazardous exposures. Their effectiveness depends on employer commitment and HCP acceptance and consistent use of the strategies.Develop mechanisms to screen patients for acute respiratory illness prior to their healthcare visits, such as through the appointment reminder system. Postpone and reschedule those with signs and symptoms presenting for non-acute visits.Nurse advice lines and telemedicine can screen and manage patients with suspected COVID-19 without the need for a face-to-face visit. Promoting the use of these technologies and referral networks can help triage persons to the appropriate level of care, potentially reducing the influx of patients to healthcare facilities and reserving personal protective equipment for when it is needed.CDC guidance recommends that, for COVID-19, only essential personnel enter the patient care area, and that facilities consider caring for these patients with dedicated HCP.  Further limiting the numbers of healthcare personnel and patient contacts to those that are medically essential (e.g., excluding dietary personnel, environmental services) could limit the number of respirators used. The medically essential personnel would assume food delivery and environmental services.Measures can be explored to limit face-to-face contact encounters between HCP and patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. HCP may consider bundling care activities to minimize room entries, and bundling may occur across HCP types (e.g., food trays are delivered by HCP performing other care). Alternative mechanisms for HCP and patient interactions include telephones, video monitoring, and video-call applications on cell phones or tablets.Restrict visitors from entering the rooms of patients with known COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19, as recommended in CDC’s guidance. Alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions, such as video-call applications on cell phones or tablets should be explored. Facilities can consider exceptions based on end-of-life situations or when a visitor is essential for the patient’s emotional well-being and care. If visitors must enter the room of a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, facilities should provide instruction, before visitors enter patients’ rooms on use of PPE according to current facility policy while in the patient’s room.Identify and assess patients who may be ill with or who may have been exposed to a person with known COVID-19. Patients with symptoms of suspected COVID-19 or other respiratory infection (e.g., fever, cough) presenting for care should use facemaskspdf icon for source control until they can be placed in a private room. Instructions should include how to use facemasks. Patients with these symptoms should not wear N95 respirators. If these patients need to leave their room for services in other areas of the hospital (e.g., radiology), they should also wear facemasks for source control.Cohorting is the practice of grouping together patients who are infected with the same organism to confine their care to one area and prevent contact with other patients. Cohorts are created based on clinical diagnosis, microbiologic confirmation when available, epidemiology, and mode of transmission of the infectious agent. Cohorting has been used extensively for managing outbreaks of multidrug resistant organisms including MRSA, VRE, MDR-ESBLs, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, RSV, adenovirus keratoconjunctivitis, rotavirus, and SARS. When single patient rooms are not available, patients with confirmed COVID-19 may be placed in the same room. Cohorting patients could minimize respirator use when extended wear of respirators is implemented.  For more information on cohorting of patients, refer to 2007 Guideline for Isolation  Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settingspdf icon.Assigning designated teams of HCP to provide care for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 could minimize respirator use when extended wear of respirators is implemented. This strategy can also limit the number of exposed HCP who need to be fit tested.It is important that HCP be trained on indications for use of N95 respirators. The OSHA Respiratory Protection standard requires employers to provide respirator training to an employee prior to use in the workplace. For example, HCP should be educated on the use of N95 respirators when caring for patients managed with airborne precautions, and other instances for respirator use, such as the performance of aerosol generating procedures.Training employees on the proper use of respirators, including putting on and removing them, limitations on their use, and maintenance is essential for effective use of respiratory protection. HCP should be thoroughly trained before they are fit tested to ensure they are comfortable donning the respirator and know how to conduct a user seal check. HCP should be trained on the respirator they are expecting to use at work.Just-in-time fit testing refers to the capacity of healthcare facilities to do larger scale evaluation, training, and fit testing of employees when necessary during a pandemic. Facilities may adopt a plan to use the “just-in-time” method for fit testing, which has been incorporated into pandemic plans for many facilities. For large facilities, it may not be feasible to fit test all employees, especially if their job does not typically place them at risk for exposure to airborne infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. If healthcare facilities are expecting to receive COVID-19 patients, they should begin training and start to plan for fit testing now. It is essential to have HCP trained and fit tested prior to receiving patients.In order to conserve the supply of N95 respirators, healthcare facilities should understand which of their HCP need to be in a respiratory protection program and thus medically evaluated, trained, and fit tested. If training and fit testing are conducted during two separate steps, it is possible to allow limited re-use of N95 respirators used by individual HCP during training and then fit testing. Employees should be fit tested after they are comfortable donning the respirator and have passed a user seal check. The respirator might also be saved and then used for patient care.Respirator fit test methods are classified as either qualitative or quantitative, and there are multiple protocols of each classification that are NIOSH-recommended or meet the requirements of OSHA’s Respiratory Protection Standardexternal icon. A qualitative fit test is a pass/fail test to assess the adequacy of respirator fit that relies on the individual’s sensory detection of a test agent. A quantitative fit test numerically measures the effectiveness of the respirator to seal with the wearer’s face, without relying on the wearer’s voluntary or involuntary response to a test agent. Quantitative fit tests involve adaptation of the respirator to the fit testing equipment, which can involve making holes in the respirator.Many healthcare systems already use qualitative fit test methods for fit testing HCP. For those using quantitative fit test methods, considerations can be made to use qualitative fit test methods to minimize the destruction of an N95 respirator used in fit testing and allow for the re-use of the same N95 respirator by the HCP. In March 2020, OSHA recommendedexternal icon healthcare employers consider changing from a quantitative fit testing method to a qualitative fit testing method. Qualitative fit methods may also allow for rapid fit testing of larger numbers of HCP. Any switch in methods should be assessed to ensure proficiency of the fit testers in carrying out the test.While engineering and administrative controls should be considered first when selecting controls, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should also be part of a suite of strategies used to protect personnel. Proper use of respiratory protection by HCP requires a comprehensive program (including medical clearance, training, and fit testing) that complies with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection Standardexternal icon and a high level of HCP involvement and commitment. The program should also include provisions for the cleaning, disinfecting, inspection, repair, and storage of respirators used by HCP on the job according to manufacturer’s instructions. Proper storage conditions can maximize shelf life of respirators. The following strategies in this section are traditionally used by some healthcare systems. If not already implemented, these strategies can be considered by healthcare settings in the face of a potential N95 respirator shortage before implementing the contingency strategies that are listed further below.N95 respirators include standard and surgical N95 respirators. In the United States, all N95 respirators used in occupational settings are approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and used in accordance with OSHA standards.A surgical N95 respirator is a NIOSH-approved N95 respirator that has also been cleared by the FDA as a surgical mask. Surgical N95 respirators (sometimes called medical respirators) are recommended only for use by HCP who need protection from both airborne and fluid hazards, such as  splashes or sprays. In times of shortage, only HCP who are working in a sterile field or who may be exposed to high-velocity splashes, sprays, or splatters of blood or body fluids should be provided these respirators. Other HCP can use standard N95 respirators. If surgical N95 respirators are not available, and there is a risk that the worker may be exposed to high velocity splashes, sprays, or splatters of blood or body fluids, then a faceshield should be worn over the standard N95 respirator.Use NIOSH approved alternatives to N95 respiratorspdf icon where feasible. These include other classes of filtering facepiece respirators, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs). All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. NIOSH maintains a searchable, online version of the certified equipment list identifying all NIOSH-approved respirators.Every other NIOSH approved filtering facepiece respirators is at least as protective as the N95. These include N99, N100, P95, P99, P100, R95, R99, and R100. Many filtering facepiece respirators have exhalation valves and should not be used in surgical settings as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field.  On March 2, 2020, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)external icon authorizing the use of certain NIOSH-approved respirator models in healthcare settings.Elastomeric respirators are half-facepiece, tight-fitting respirators that are made of synthetic or rubber material permitting them to be repeatedly disinfected, cleaned, and reused. They are equipped with replaceable filter cartridges. Similar to N95 respirators, elastomeric respirators require annual fit testing. Elastomeric respirators should not be used in surgical settings due to concerns that air coming out of the exhalation valve may contaminate the sterile field.PAPRs are reusable respirators that are typically loose-fitting hoods or helmets. These respirators are battery-powered with blower that pulls air through attached filters or cartridges. The filter is typically a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Loose-fitting PAPRs do not require fit-testing and can be worn by people with facial hair. However, PAPRs should not be used in surgical settings due to concerns that the blower exhaust and exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field.On March 28, 2020, FDA issued an update to address NIOSH-Approved Air Purifying Respirators for Use in Health Care Settings During Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergencyexternal icon. Facilities using elastomeric respirators and PAPRs should have up-to-date cleaning/disinfection procedures, which are an essential part of use for protection against infectious agents.Decisions to implement contingency are based upon these assumptions:Currently, CDC recommends discharge of patients with confirmed COVID-19 when they are medically stable and have an appropriate home environment to which to return. CDC lists considerations for care at home in: Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). If patients cannot be discharged to home for social rather than medical reasons, public health officials might need to identify alternative non-hospital housing where those patients can convalesce.Facilities can consider temporarily suspending annual fit testing of HCP in times of expected shortages. In March 2020, OSHA issued new temporary guidanceexternal icon regarding the enforcement of OSHA’s Respiratory Protection Standard. The guidance gave OSHA field offices enforcement discretion concerning the annual fit testing requirement as long as HCP have undergone an initial fit test with the same model, style, and size. Other conditions include explaining to HCP the importance of conducting a user seal check each time the respirator is put on and conducting a fit test if there are visual changes to the employee’s physical condition.In times of shortage, consideration can be made to use N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life. However, expired respirators might not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the strap and material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Because of this, use of expired respirators could be prioritized for situations where HCP are NOT exposed to pathogens, such as training and fit testing.  As expired respirators can still serve an important purpose, healthcare facilities should retain and reserve all N95 respirators during the pandemic.Practices allowing extended use of N95 respirators, when acceptable, can also be considered. The decision to implement policies that permit extended use of N95 respirators should be made by the professionals who manage the institution’s respiratory protection program, in consultation with their occupational health and infection control departments with input from the state/local public health departments. CDC has recommended guidance on implementation of extended use of N95 respirators in healthcare settings. Extended use has been recommended and widely used as an option for conserving respirators during previous respiratory pathogen outbreaks and pandemics.Extended use refers to the practice of wearing the same N95 respirator for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing the respirator between patient encounters. Extended use is well suited to situations wherein multiple patients with the same infectious disease diagnosis, whose care requires use of a respirator, are cohorted (e.g., housed on the same hospital unit). It can also be considered to be used for care of patients with tuberculosis, varicella, and measles, other infectious diseases where use of an N95 respirator or higher is recommended. When practicing extended use of N95 respirators, the maximum recommended extended use period is 8–12 hours. Respirators should not be worn for multiple work shifts and should not be reused after extended use. N95 respirators should be removed (doffed) and discarded before activities such as meals and restroom breaks.Decisions to implement crisis strategies are based upon these assumptions:Consideration can be made to use N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for care of patients with COVID-19, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella. However, respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life may not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the straps and nose bridge material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Many models found in U.S. stockpiles and stockpiles of healthcare facilities have been found to continue to perform in accordance with NIOSH performance standards. However, fluid resistance and flammability were not assessed. Use of the N95 respirators recommended in Release of Stockpiled N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Beyond the Manufacturer-Designated Shelf Life: Considerations for the COVID-19 Response can be considered. It is optimal to use these respirators in the context of a respiratory protection program that includes medical evaluation, training, and fit testing. If used in healthcare delivery, it is particularly important that HCP perform the expected seal check, prior to entering a patient care area. CDC does not recommend using N95s beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life in surgical settings. On March 2, 2020, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authorizing the use of certain NIOSH-approved respirator models in healthcare settings. This EUA includes respirator units that are past their designated shelf life.Other countries approve respirators for occupational use according to country-specific standards. These products are evaluated using some methods that are similar to those used by NIOSH. Some methods are different but are expected to provide protection similar to NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece and elastomeric respirators. Devices supplied by current NIOSH-approval holders producing respirators under the standards authorized in the listed countries are expected to provide the protection indicated, given that a proper fit is achieved. Therefore, they are considered to be suitable alternatives to provide protection during the COVID-19 response when supplies are short. Within the following tables, the country, conformity assessment standards, standards and guidance documents, acceptable product classification, and NIOSH classification are provided in alphabetical order. All of these respirators have protection factors of at least 10 in the countries listed below, as outlined in the standards and guidance documents specified. Non-NIOSH approved products developed by manufacturers who are not NIOSH approval holders are expected to meet the performance requirements if they have been issued a certificate of approval by an authorized test laboratory indicating they conform to the standards below. Non-NIOSH-approved products developed by manufacturers who are not NIOSH approval holders, including only products approved by and received from China, should only be used in crisis situations when no other NIOSH-approved N95 respirator (or a listed device from one of the other countries identified within the FDA EAU) is available; they should not be used during aerosol generating medical procedures unless the alternative is a loose-fitting surgical mask or improvised device. On April 3, 2020, FDA issued an update to the Non-NIOSH Approved Respirator Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)external icon concerning non-NIOSH-approved respirators that have been approved in other countries. Visit the NIOSH Science Blog for additional information on understanding the use of imported Non-NIOSH-approved respirators. GB 2626-2019GB19083-2010Show More GB 2626-2019EN 143-2000Re-use refers to the practice of using the same N95 respirator by one HCP for multiple encounters with different patients but removing it (i.e. doffing) after each encounter. This practice is often referred to as “limited reuse” because restrictions are in place to limit the number of times the same respirator is reused. It is important to consult with the respirator manufacturer regarding the maximum number of donnings or uses they recommend for the N95 respirator model. If no manufacturer guidance is available, data suggest limiting the number of reuses to no more than five uses per device to ensure an adequate safety margin.1 N95 and other disposable respirators should not be shared by multiple HCP. CDC has recommended guidance on implementation of limited re-use of N95 respirators in healthcare settings.For pathogens for which contact transmission is not a concern, routine limited reuse of single-use disposable respirators has been practiced for decades. For example, for tuberculosis prevention, a respirator classified as disposable can be reused by the same provider as long as the respirator maintains its structural and functional integrity. If reuse must be implemented in times of shortages, HCP could be encouraged to reuse their N95 respirators when caring for patients with tuberculosis disease first.Limited re-use of N95 respirators when caring for patients with COVID-19 might also become necessary. However, it is unknown what the potential contribution of contact transmission is for SARS-CoV-2, and caution should be used. Re-use should be implemented according to CDC guidance. Re-use has been recommended as an option for conserving respirators during previous respiratory pathogen outbreaks and pandemics. It may also be necessary to re-use N95 respirators when caring for patients with varicella or measles, although contact transmission poses a risk to HCP who implement this practice. Ideally, N95 respirators should not be re-used by HCP who care for patients with COVID-19 then care for other patients with varicella, measles, and tuberculosis, and vice versa.Respirators grossly contaminated with blood, respiratory or nasal secretions, or other bodily fluids from patients should be discarded. HCP can consider using a face shield or facemask over the respirator to reduce/prevent contamination of the N95 respirator. HCP re-using an N95 respirators should use a clean pair of gloves when donning or adjusting a previously worn N95 respirator. It is important to discard gloves and perform hand hygiene after the N95 respirator is donned or adjusted.The surfaces of a properly donned and functioning NIOSH-approved N95 respirator will become contaminated with pathogens while filtering the inhalation air of the wearer during exposures to pathogen laden aerosols. The pathogens on the filter materials of the respirator may be transferred to the wearer upon contact with the respirator during activities such as adjusting the respirator, improper doffing of the respirator, or when performing a user-seal check when redonnng a previously worn respirator. One effective strategy to mitigate the contact transfer of pathogens from the respirator to the wearer could be to issue each HCP who may be exposed to COVID-19 patients a minimum of five respirators. Each respirator will be used on a particular day and stored in a breathable paper bag until the next week. This will result in each worker requiring a minimum of five N95 respirators if they put on, take off, care for them, and store them properly each day.  This amount of time in between uses should exceed the 72 hour expected survival time for SARS-CoV2 (the virus that caused COVID-19).3 HCP should still treat the respirator as though it is still contaminated and follow the precautions outlined in CDC’s re-use recommendations.Respirator manufacturers may provide guidance for respirator decontamination. At present, there are no generally approved methods for N95 and other disposable respirator decontamination prior to re-use.  Additional guidance on potential methods may be found here.Use of additional N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for care of patients with COVID-19, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella can be considered. However, respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life may not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the straps and nose bridge material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Some models have been found NOT to perform in accordance with NIOSH performances standards, and consideration may be given to use these respirators as identified in Release of Stockpiled N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Beyond the Manufacturer-Designated Shelf Life: Considerations for the COVID-19 Response. In addition, consideration can be given to use N95 respirators that have not been evaluated by NIOSH beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life. These respirators should ideally be used in the context of a respiratory protection program that includes medical evaluation, training, and fit testing. It is particularly important that HCP perform the expected seal check, prior to entering a patient care area.The number of infectious particles required to cause an infection (infectious dose) is often uncertain or unknown for respiratory pathogens. Further, there is often uncertainty about the influence of factors such as exposure duration and nature of clinical symptoms on the likelihood of infection transmission from person-to-person. When facemasks must be used by HCP entering a patient care area, source control (i.e. masking of symptomatic patients) and maintaining distance from the patient are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission.This prioritization approach to conservation is intended to be used when N95 respirators are so limited that routinely practiced standards of care for all HCP wearing N95 respirators when caring for a COVID-19 patient are no longer possible. N95 respirators beyond their manufacture-designated shelf life, when available, are preferable to use of facemasks. The use of N95s or elastomeric respirators or PAPRs should be prioritized for HCP with the highest potential exposures including being present in the room during aerosol generating procedures performed on symptomatic persons.However, HCP should consider not entering the patient care area.However, HCP should consider not entering the patient care area.During severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.It may be possible to designate HCP who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 to preferentially provide care for additional patients with COVID-19. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection may have developed some protective immunity, but this has not yet been proven.Portable fan devices with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration that are carefully placed can increase the effective air changes per hour of clean air to the patient room, reducing risk to individuals entering the room without respiratory protection. NIOSH has developed guidance for using portable HEPA filtration systems to create expedient patient isolation rooms. The expedient patient isolation room approach involves establishing a high-ventilation-rate, negative pressure, inner isolation zone that sits within a “clean” larger ventilated zone. In the absence of any remaining supply of N95 respirators, it may be possible to use this technology in conjunction with HCP wearing facemasks.NIOSH has developed the ventilated headboard that draws exhaled air from a patient in bed into a HEPA filter, decreasing risk of HCP exposure to patient-generated aerosol. This technology consists of lightweight, sturdy, and adjustable aluminum framing with a retractable plastic canopy. The ventilated headboard can be deployed in combination with HEPA fan/filter units to provide surge isolation capacity within a variety of environments, from traditional patient rooms to triage stations, and emergency medical shelters. In the absence of any remaining supply of N95 respirators, it may be possible to use this technology in conjunction with HCP and/or patients wearing facemasks.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Find pages with...As some communities in the United States begin to plan and hold events and gatherings, the CDC offers the following considerations for enhancing protection of individuals and communities and preventing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Event planners and officials can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Because COVID-19 virus circulation varies in communities, these considerations are meant to supplement—not replace—any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which gatherings must comply. Organizers should continue to assess, based on current conditions, whether to postpone, cancel, or significantly reduce the number of attendees for gatherings.The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events, and gatherings.More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area.Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is thought to be mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It is thought that the virus may also spread to hands from a contaminated surface and then to the nose, mouth or eyes, causing infection. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing, staying home when sick, maintaining 6 feet of distance, and wearing a cloth face covering) and environmental prevention practices (such as cleaning and disinfection) are important ways to prevent the virus’s spread.These prevention principles are covered in this document. They provide event planners and individuals with actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during gatherings and events.Event planners should consider implementing strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19 among staff and attendees.Event planners should consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy environments.Event organizers and staff may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations.Event planners should consider several strategies to implement when someone gets sick.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and do not infect humans.We are still learning about the virus that causes COVID-19, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. A small number of pets worldwide, including cats and dogs, have been reportedexternal icon to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19.Infected pets might get sick or they might not have any symptoms. Of the pets that have gotten sick, most only had mild illness and fully recovered.Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from a possible infection.Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread the virus to animals, CDC recommends that pet owners limit their pet’s interaction with people outside their household.There is no evidence that the virus can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use.Talk to your veterinarian if your pet gets sick or if you have any concerns about your pet’s health.external iconexternal iconexternal iconIf you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), you should restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would with people. Until we know more about this virus, people sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals.If you are sick with COVID-19 and your pet becomes sick, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know you have been sick with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.For more information visit: What to Do if You are Sick.In the United States, there is no evidence that animals are playing a significant role in the spread of COVID-19.  Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals.For more information, visit CDC’s COVID-19 and Animals webpage and Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Find pages with...Updated June 22, 2020Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes.A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. See People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness.The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website.​At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online. See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.Visit the How to Protect Yourself & Others page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.Wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.While people who are sick or know that they have COVID-19 should isolate at home, COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That’s why it’s important for everyone to practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear cloth face coverings in public settings. Cloth face coverings provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people.The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.  Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.More information about cloth face coverings can be found on our cloth face coverings site.For more information, see Groups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness.There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.Find more information about how coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself.Visit CDC’s contact lens website for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care.Find more information about how coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself.Visit CDC’s contact lens website for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care.Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. However, a few children have developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Currently, information about this syndrome is limited. CDC is working with state and local health departments to learn more about MIS-C.You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at How to Protect Yourself & Others. Additional information on how COVID-19 is spread is available at How COVID-19 Spreads.More information on Keeping Children Healthy during the COVID-19 Outbreak is available online.No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. COVID-19 can look different in different people. For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the flu. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems.CDC and partners are investigating cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. Learn more about COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. When you talk with your child, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. Talk to your children about COVID-19 and help them cope with stress.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. We do not yet know what causes MIS-C. However, we know that many children with MIS-C had the virus that causes COVID-19, or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS-C can be serious, even deadly, but most children who were diagnosed with this condition have gotten better with medical care.Contact your child’s doctor, nurse, or clinic right away if your child is showing symptoms of MIS-C. Seek emergency care right away if your child is showing any of these emergency warning signs of MIS-C or other concerning signs.No. The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk.For more information, see Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in Children.For more information, see Help Children Learn at Home.Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.For more information, see Keep Children Healthy during the COVID-19 Outbreak.Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.It’s not known yet whether all children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk. CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.Additional information on caring for children and on child development specific conditions are available.Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations. You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your family’s situation. It is important to continue your family’s coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.See information on ways to cope with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger.
If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others:If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911. If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.Notify your child’s healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child.See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19.If your child’s healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same. These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the school’s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.  If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See CDC’s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product. Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon. Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below:Protect yourself and others.Put your household plan into action.Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses. CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities. These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  “stay at home” or “shelter in place.” What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities. These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.Please contact your local health department to find out more.CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test, if a test was performed, contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you. Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.CDC has guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html.CDC also has guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html.In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department. Local decisions depend on local circumstances.People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.Read more about COVID-19 Symptoms.When to Seek Emergency Medical AttentionLook for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.Yes. It is possible to test positive for flu (as well as other respiratory infections) and COVID-19 at the same time.Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.You can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. See Test for Past Infection for more information.Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: viral tests and antibody tests. A viral test checks for a current infection. An antibody test checks for a previous infection.If you think you need a viral test, call your healthcare provider or state or localexternal icon health department and tell them about your symptoms and how you think you may have been exposed to the virus. Your healthcare provider can let you know if they offer viral tests at their office. Your state or local health department can provide local information on where testing is available. See Testing for Current Infection for more information.If you want an antibody test, call your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one. You can also visit your state or local health department’s website for local information on antibody testing.Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others. See Testing for Current Infection for more information.Viral tests are used to diagnose COVID-19. These tests tell you if you currently have an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. There are many viral tests available. All of the viral tests identify the virus in respiratory samples, such as from swabs from the inside of your nose.Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the laboratory receives your samples. Two tests allow you to collect your sample at home – either a swab from the inside of your nose or a saliva sample – but you will still need to send the sample to a laboratory for processing.Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested). Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses. You can find a patient information sheet about each test on FDA’s websiteexternal icon.Antibody testing checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. When someone gets COVID-19, their body usually makes antibodies. However, it typically takes one to three weeks to develop these antibodies. Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop antibodies. A positive result from this test may mean that person was previously infected with the virus. Talk to your healthcare provider about what your antibody test result means.Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose COVID-19. To see if you are currently infected, you need a viral test. Viral tests identify the virus in respiratory samples, such as swabs from the inside of your nose.We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 can protect someone from getting infected again or, if they do, how long this protection might last. Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions.We do not know yet if people who recover from COVID-19 can get infected again. CDC and partners are investigating to determine if a person can get sick with COVID-19 more than once. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.This list is based on:As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed.Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible. Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more. People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your body’s function.  You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.  Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.Contact tracing is used by health departments to prevent the spread of infectious disease. In general, contact tracing involves identifying people who have an infectious disease (cases) and their contacts (people who may have been exposed) and working with them to interrupt disease transmission. For COVID-19, this includes asking cases to isolate and contacts to quarantine at home voluntarily.Contact tracing for COVID-19 typically involvesTo prevent the further spread of disease, COVID-19 contacts are encouraged to stay home and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others until 14 days after their last exposure to a person with COVID-19. Contacts should monitor themselves by checking their temperature twice daily and watching for symptoms of COVID-19.Generally, contact tracing includes the following steps:For COVID-19, a close contact is defined as anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 48 hours before the person began feeling sick until the time the patient was isolated.If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, a case investigator from the health department may call you to check-in on your health, discuss who you’ve been in contact with, and ask where you spent time while you may have been infectious and able to spread COVID-19 to others. You will also be asked to stay at home and self-isolate, if you are not doing so already.Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face.If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, a contact tracer from the health department might contact you to inform you that you’ve been exposed to COVID-19.You should stay at home and self-quarantine for 14 days, starting from the last day you were possibly exposed to COVID-19. The contact tracer will help identify the dates of your self-quarantine. The contact tracer can also provide resources about COVID-19 testing in your area.You should take your temperature twice a day, watch for symptoms of COVID-19, and notify your health department if you develop symptoms. You should also notify people you had close contact with recently if you become ill, so they can monitor their health. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face.Yes, you are still considered a close contact even if you were wearing a cloth face covering while you were around someone with COVID-19. Cloth face coverings are meant to prevent someone from transmitting the disease to others, and not to protect someone from becoming infected.Discussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider.Your name will not be revealed to those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify your close contacts that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. How data are collected, stored, and shared are specific to each state or jurisdiction.If you have been around someone who was identified as a close contact to a person with COVID-19, you should closely monitor yourself for any symptoms of COVID-19. You do not need to self-quarantine.There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19.COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturer’s label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Additional information on how to safely conduct aerosol-generating procedures is in the CDC’s Postmortem Guidance. Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time).After cleaning and removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.The belongings of someone who has died of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 outside their home (for example, in a hospital setting) may be returned to family members along with instructions for cleaning and disinfection. Depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility.Family members should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling these items. Depending on the belongings received, family members should also follow the household item-specific cleaning and disinfection guidelines for personal items, such as electronics.When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased person’s next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of State’s Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:Please see CDC’s guidance for additional information.CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response. This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. CDC works 24/7 to protect people’s health. More information about CDC’s response to COVID-19 is available online.Cleaning with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. If vacuuming is necessary or required in a school, business, or community facility that was used by a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, first follow the CDC recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical.After cleaning and disinfection, the following recommendations may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming:Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. Cleaning removes dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface.Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces.Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used.Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i.e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Once the area has been appropriately disinfected, it can be opened for use. Workers without close contact with the person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed.The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identified on List Nexternal icon against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19.Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e.g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e.g., mulch, sand) is not recommended.CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective on these surfaces.At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.  A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.No. At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, includingIf you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19. A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.Walking your dog is important for both animal and human health and wellbeing. Walk dogs on a leash, and stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. Do not gather in groups, stay out of crowded places, and avoid mass gatherings. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.See “Can I take my dog to a dog park?” for information on dog parks.Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread it to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather.Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park.See more information on pets and COVID-19 and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe.Until we know more about how this virus affects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather.Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. If you must take your pet to a groomer or boarding facility, follow any protocols put into place at the facility, such as wearing a cloth face covering and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible.Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). Use an EPA-registered disinfectantexternal icon to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use.Do not put face coverings on pets, and do not take a sick pet to a groomer or boarding facility. Signs of sickness in animals may include:If you think your pet is sick, call your veterinarian. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.See more information on pets and COVID-19 and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe.There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances. Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis. For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animal’s veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19.Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19.Talk to a veterinarian if a pet in your facility gets sick or if you have any concerns about the health of any pets in the facility. If you think a pet in the facility was exposed to or is showing signs consistent with COVID-19, contact your state health official to discuss guidance on testing pets or other animals for the virus that causes COVID-19.People who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid providing care for sick pets, if possible.For more information, visit CDC’s If You Have Pets webpage.CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.Please refer to CDC’s requirements for bringing a dog to the United States. The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19.Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game.  Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations:You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at your facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility.For more information, see Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon and Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).See also: Pets and Other AnimalsCommunity mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Community mitigation is especially important before a vaccine or drug becomes widely available.Some community mitigation actions may include:Individuals, communities, schools, businesses and healthcare organizations all have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies.Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be impacted need to be considered, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness, and those who might be more impacted socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation.Putting mitigation into practice is based on:*CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department. Local decisions depend on local circumstances.The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Additionally, proper operation of these aquatic venues and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus.While there is ongoing community spread of the virus, it is important for individuals, as well as operators of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds (for example, at hotels or apartment complexes or owned by communities) to take steps to ensure health and safety:The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. Researchers do not know whether this virus can cause disease if a person is exposed to untreated wastewater or sewerage systems. There is no evidence to date that this has occurred. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low.Recently, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater.Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. These standard practices can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.In most cases, it is safe to wash your hands with soap and tap water during a Boil Water Advisory. Follow the guidance from your local public health officials. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.1Fever may be subjective or confirmed2Close contact is defined as—a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case– or –b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met”See CDC’s updated Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus.Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.To receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Find pages with...The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety about a new disease and what could happen can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Public health actions, such as social distancing, can make people feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. However, these actions are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Coping with stress in a healthy way will make you, the people you care about, and your community stronger. Stress during an infectious disease outbreak can sometimes cause the following:You may experience increased stress during this pandemic. Fear and anxiety can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions.Get immediate help in a crisisFind a health care provider or treatment for substance use disorder and mental healthHow you respond to the COVID-19 pandemic can depend on your background, your social support from family or friends, your financial situation, your health and emotional background, the community you live in, and many other factors. The changes that can happen because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ways we try to contain the spread of the virus can affect anyone.People who may respond more strongly to the stress of a crisis include:Taking care of your friends and your family can be a stress reliever, but it should be balanced with care for yourself. Helping others cope with their stress, such as by providing social support, can also make your community stronger. During times of increased social distancing, people can still maintain social connections and care for their mental health. Virtual communication (like phones or video chats) can help you and your loved ones feel less lonely and isolated.Knowing the facts about COVID-19 and stopping the spread of rumors can help reduce stress and stigma. Understanding the risk to yourself and people you care about can help you connect with others and make an outbreak less stressful.Mental health is an important part of overall health and wellbeing. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It may also affect how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices during an emergency.People with pre-existing mental health conditions or substance use disorders may be particularly vulnerable in an emergency. Mental health conditions (such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia) affect a person’s thinking, feeling, mood or behavior in a way that influences their ability to relate to others and function each day. These conditions may be situational (short-term) or long-lasting (chronic). People with preexisting mental health conditions should continue with their treatment and be aware of new or worsening symptoms. If you think you have new or worse symptoms, call your healthcare provider.Call your healthcare provider if stress gets in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row. Free and confidential resources can also help you or a loved one connect with a skilled, trained counselor in your area.SuicideDifferent life experiences affect a person’s risk for suicide. For example, suicide risk is higher among people who have experienced violence, including child abuse, bullying, or sexual violence. Feelings of isolation, depression, anxiety, and other emotional or financial stresses are known to raise the risk for suicide. People may be more likely to experience these feelings during a crisis like a pandemic.However, there are ways to protect against suicidal thoughts and behaviors. For example, support from family and community, or feeling connected, and having access to in-person or virtual counseling or therapy can help with suicidal thoughts and behavior, particularly during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.Learn more about CDC’s work in suicide prevention.It can be stressful to be separated from others if you have or were exposed to COVID-19. Each person ending a period of home isolation may feel differently about it.Emotional reactions may include:Children may also feel upset or have other strong emotions if they, or someone they know, has COVID-19, even if they are now better and able to be around others again.For EveryoneFor CommunitiesFor Families and ChildrenFor People at Higher Risk for Serious IllnessFor Healthcare Workers and First RespondersFor Other WorkersTo receive email updates about COVID-19, enter your email address:

Iowa banks are taking steps to protect their communities, continue banking services, and assist Iowans through this difficult timeJOHNSTON, IOWA (March 17, 2020) — Iowa banks are doing their part to protect our communities in this time of social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. For some time, banks have been investing in technology to meet customers where they are — through online and mobile banking. Iowans can check account balances, transfer money and deposit checks without leaving their home.Many banks are encouraging use of their online, mobile, ATM or drive-thru options when you conduct banking over the next month. Some are taking the added step of limiting access to physical locations to protect customers and staff. Even with these changes, customers can be assured that they’ll continue to have access to their money. We urge your patience and understanding during this time.Iowa banks are working with consumers and businesses who have been economically impacted by COVID-19. In many cases, banks are providing targeted relief or support for those affected. This low interest rate environment may also offer Iowans opportunities to borrow or refinance loans for a home, business or other purpose.The coronavirus is also impacting the financial markets. Volatile markets are a reminder of the importance of a diversified allocation for your savings and investments. Local banks are Iowans’ first choice for protecting their hard-earned dollars. Deposits up to $250,000 are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and are backed by an additional $10 billion in bank capital. In addition, the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund, supported by bank premiums, is in strong financial condition with over $110 billion in reserve.Iowa banks know well that their success is tied directly to the success of their customers and communities. The Iowa banking system has never been stronger or better able to assist Iowans during challenging times. The Iowa Bankers Association urges you to contact your local bank to learn more about how they can be of assistance.About the Iowa Bankers Association

Please use a web browser with javascript enabled to view this page.FDIC Consumer News - Covid-19 Special EditionPrintable VersionCovid-19 - PDFVersion imprimible en EspañolCovid-19 en español - PDF The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is working with federal and state banking agencies and financial institutions to assist customers affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. The following information is more important than ever during these challenging times. Advances in mobile banking technology enable you to exercise social distancing (To Beat COVID-19, Social Distancing is a Must) and conduct banking transactions at the same time. Banking technology and services provide the convenience of conducting banking transactions with your computer, smartphone, or mobile computer device. If you aren’t using these services, ask your bank if the following are available to you and how you can activate them.Money Transfer Services:Person-to-person payment services and mobile payment apps have become part of everyday life for many people. Payment services and apps let you send money to people without having to write a check, swipe a card, or hand them cash.Online Bill Pay Services:These programs generally allow you to sign up on your bank’s website to receive bills electronically from companies you do business with. Then you can review the bill and pay it online.Depositing Checks Using Remote  Deposit Capture:Many banks allow customers to use Remote Deposit Capture (RDC), which allows customers to take a picture of a check with their mobile device and deposit that check electronically without ever visiting a branch or using an ATM. You can find additional tips on mobile banking technology by visiting: Banking at the Speed of Technology.Some banks may have adjusted hours or services to observe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance on social distancing, but that doesn’t change the fact that an FDIC-insured account remains the safest place for you to keep your money. FDIC’s Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE) can help you determine deposit insurance coverage based on accounts you already have with a bank  or accounts you are considering opening. Find additional help using the EDIE Calculator at FDIC deposit insurance coverage.As a reminder, keeping large sums of  cash in your home is not advisable  because it puts these funds at risk of theft, fire, flood, loss, or damage. Also, because  of the physical interaction and exchange  of currency, paper money has the potential of harboring germs and bacteria, another drawback of storing large sums of cash in your home (see New coronavirus stable for hours on surfaces). Areas across the United States are undergoing temporary closure of schools, businesses, and events in an effort to reduce the potential exposure to COVID-19. Albeit necessary to contain the spread of this pandemic, many may experience loss of income because of illness or impacts to their workplace. The FDIC is encouraging banks to work with their customers experiencing the impact of COVID-19 by, for example, allowing them to skip loan payments with no adverse consequences, extending loan terms, and restructuring loans. Contact your bank to discuss your options before skipping any payments or taking any other action contrary to the terms of your loan.  Unfortunately, some people may take advantage of COVID-19 by using fraudulent websites, phone calls, emails, and text messages. While claiming to offer “help,” they may be trying to trick people into providing social security numbers, bank account numbers, and other valuable personal information. Do not divulge your bank or credit card numbers or any other personal information over the phone unless you initiated the conversation with the other party and you know that it is a reputable organization.In addition, you should be cautious about online solicitations. Be on guard against imposters who contact you claiming to be government employees or volunteers and who ask for personal financial information or money. Learn more about how to protect yourself from these scams in the March 2020 edition of Consumer News.Reject offers to cash a check for someone in exchange for a fee, even if the bank makes the funds available to you right away, as it may later turn out that the check was fraudulent. Read more about fake checks in the August 2019 edition  of Consumer News. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has additional information at Avoid Coronavirus Scams.Additional Resources: For more help or information, go to FDIC.gov or

Find pages with...Cleaning & Disinfecting Decision ToolReopening Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfecting pdf icon[PDF – 9 pages]This guidance is intended for all Americans, whether you own a business, run a school, or want to ensure the cleanliness and safety of your home. Reopening America requires all of us to move forward together by practicing social distancing and other daily habits to reduce our risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Reopening the country also strongly relies on public health strategies, including increased testing of people for the virus, social distancing, isolation, and keeping track of how someone infected might have infected other people. This plan is part of the larger United States Government plan external iconand focuses on cleaning and disinfecting public spaces, workplaces, businesses, schools, and can also be applied to your home.Cleaning and disinfecting public spaces including your workplace, school, home, and business will require you to:Reducing the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by cleaning and disinfection is an important part of reopening public spaces that will require careful planning. Every American has been called upon to slow the spread of the virus through social distancing and prevention hygiene, such as frequently washing your hands and wearing face coverings. Everyone also has a role in making sure our communities are as safe as possible to reopen and remain open.The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed if you use the right products. EPA has compiled a list of disinfectant products that can be used against COVID-19, including ready-to-use sprays, concentrates, and wipes. Each product has been shown to be effective against viruses that are harder to kill than viruses like the one that causes COVID-19.This document provides a general framework for cleaning and disinfection practices. The framework is based on doing the following:Always read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use.You should never eat, drink, breathe or inject these products into your body or apply directly to your skin as they can cause serious harm. Do not wipe or bathe pets with these products or any other products that are not approved for animal use.See EPA’s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal iconLinks to specific recommendations for many public spaces that use this framework, can be found at the end of this document.It’s important to continue to follow federal, state, tribal, territorial, and local guidance for reopening America.If you oversee staff in a workplace, your plan should include considerations about the safety of custodial staff and other people who are carrying out the cleaning or disinfecting. These people are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus and to any toxic effects of the cleaning chemicals. These staff should wear appropriate PPE for cleaning and disinfecting. To protect your staff and to ensure that the products are used effectively, staff should be instructed on how to apply the disinfectants according to the label. For more information on concerns related to cleaning staff, visit the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s website on Control and Prevention.external iconEvaluate your workplace, school, home, or business to determine what kinds of surfaces and materials make up that area. Most surfaces and objects will just need normal routine cleaning. Frequently touched surfaces and objects like light switches and doorknobs will need to be cleaned and then disinfected to further reduce the risk of germs on surfaces and objects.You should also consider what items can be moved or removed completely to reduce frequent handling or contact from multiple people. Soft and porous materials, such as area rugs and seating, may be removed or stored to reduce the challenges with cleaning and disinfecting them. Find additional reopening guidance for cleaning and disinfecting in the Reopening Decision Toolpdf icon.It is critical that your plan includes how to maintain a cleaning and disinfecting strategy after reopening. Develop a flexible plan with your staff or family, adjusting the plan as federal, state, tribal, territorial, or local guidance is updated and if your specific circumstances change.Some surfaces only need to be cleaned with soap and water. For example, surfaces and objects that are not frequently touched should be cleaned and do not require additional disinfection. Additionally, disinfectants should typically not be applied on items used by children, especially any items that children might put in their mouths. Many disinfectants are toxic when swallowed. In a household setting, cleaning toys and other items used by children with soap and water is usually sufficient. Find more information on cleaning and disinfection toys and other surfaces in the childcare program setting at CDC’s Guidance for Childcare Programs that Remain Open.These questions will help you decide which surfaces and objects will need normal routine cleaning.Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and in parks is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas.The targeted use of disinfectants can be done effectively, efficiently and safely on outdoor hard surfaces and objects frequently touched by multiple people. Certain outdoor areas and facilities, such as bars and restaurants, may have additional requirements. More information can be found on FDA’s website on Food Safety and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)external icon.There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread directly to humans from water in pools, hot tubs or spas, or water play areas. Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (for example, with chlorine or bromine) of pools, hot tubs or spas, and water playgrounds should kill the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there are additional concerns with outdoor areas that may be maintained less frequently, including playgrounds, or other facilities located within local, state, or national parks. For more information, visit CDC’s website on Visiting Parks & Recreational Facilities.If your workplace, school, or business has been unoccupied for 7 days or more, it will only need your normal routine cleaning to reopen the area. This is because the virus that causes COVID-19 has not been shown to survive on surfaces longer than this time.There are many public health considerations, not just COVID-19 related, when reopening public buildings and spaces that have been closed for extended periods. For example, take measures to ensure the safety of your building water system. It is not necessary to clean ventilation systems, other than routine maintenance, as part of reducing risk of corona viruses. For healthcare facilities, additional guidance is provided on CDC’s Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilitiespdf icon.Following your normal routine cleaning, you can disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects using a product from EPA’s list of approved products that are effective against  COVID-19.external iconThese questions will help you choose appropriate disinfectants.Consult EPA’s list of approved products for use against COVID-19external icon. This list will help you determine the most appropriate disinfectant for the surface or object. You can use diluted household bleach solutions if appropriate for the surface. Pay special attention to the personal protective equipment (PPE) that may be needed to safely apply the disinfectant and the manufacturer’s recommendations concerning any additional hazards. Keep all disinfectants out of the reach of children. Please visit CDC’s website on How to Clean and Disinfect for additional details and warnings.Examples of frequently touched surfaces and objects that will need routine disinfection following reopening are:Each business or facility will have different surfaces and objects that are frequently touched by multiple people. Appropriately disinfect these surfaces and objects. For example, transit stations have specific guidance for application of cleaning and disinfection.Soft and porous materials are generally not as easy to disinfect as hard and non-porous surfaces. EPA has listed a limited number of products approved for disinfection for use on soft and porous materialsexternal icon. Soft and porous materials that are not frequently touched should only be cleaned or laundered, following the directions on the item’s label, using the warmest appropriate water setting. Find more information on CDC’s website on Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility for developing strategies for dealing with soft and porous materials.Keep in mind the availability of cleaning and disinfection products and appropriate PPE. Always wear gloves appropriate for the chemicals being used for routine cleaning and disinfecting. Follow the directions on the disinfectant label for additional PPE needs. In specific instances, personnel with specialized training and equipment may be required to apply certain disinfectants such as fumigants or fogs. For more information on appropriate PPE for cleaning and disinfection, see CDC’s website on Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities.Once you have a plan, it’s time to take action. Read all manufacturer’s instructions for the cleaning and disinfection products you will use. Put on your gloves and other required personal protective equipment (PPE) to begin the process of cleaning and disinfecting.Clean surfaces and objects using soap and water prior to disinfection. Always wear gloves appropriate for the chemicals being used for routine cleaning and disinfecting. Follow the directions on the disinfectant label for additional PPE needs. When you finish cleaning, remember to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.Clean or launder soft and porous materials like seating in an office or coffee shop, area rugs, and carpets. Launder items according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using the warmest temperature setting possible and dry items completely. EPA approved disinfectantsexternal icon, when applied according to the manufacturer’s label, are effective for use against COVID-19. Follow the instructions on the label for all cleaning and disinfection products for concentration, dilution, application method, contact time and any other special considerations when applying.Follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many product labels recommend keeping the surface wet for a specific amount of time. The label will also list precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. Keep all disinfectants out of the reach of children.Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 during daily activities. CDC provides tips to reduce your exposure and risk of acquiring COVID-19. Reducing exposure to yourself and others is a shared responsibility. Continue to update your plan based on updated guidance and your current circumstances.Routine cleaning and disinfecting are an important part of reducing the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Normal routine cleaning with soap and water alone can reduce risk of exposure and is a necessary step before you disinfect dirty surfaces.Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, desks, phones, light switches, and faucets, should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use.Consider choosing a different disinfectant if your first choice is in short supply. Make sure there is enough supply of gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) based on the label, the amount of product you will need to apply, and the size of the surface you are treating.We have all had to make significant behavioral changes to reduce the spread of COVID-19. To reopen America, we will need to continue these practices:It’s important to continue to follow federal, state, tribal, territorial, and local guidance for reopening America. Check this resource for updates on COVID-19external icon. This will help you change your plan when situations are updated.It is also essential to change the ways we use public spaces to work, live, and play. We should continue thinking about our safety and the safety of others.To reduce your exposure to or the risk of spreading COVID-19 after reopening your business or facility, consider whether you need to touch certain surfaces or materials. Consider wiping public surfaces before and after you touch them. These types of behavioral adjustments can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. There are other resources for more information on COVID-19 external iconand how to Prevent Getting Sick.Another way to reduce the risk of exposure is to make long-term changes to practices and procedures. These could include reducing the use of porous materials used for seating, leaving some doors open to reduce touching by multiple people, opening windows to improve ventilation, or removing objects in your common areas, like coffee creamer containers. There are many other steps that businesses and institutions can put into place to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect their staff and the public. More information can be found at CDC’s Implementation of Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 Transmissionpdf icon.Reopening America requires all of us to move forward together using recommended best practices and maintaining safe daily habits in order to reduce our risk of exposure to COVID-19.

Back t
o Work Considerations
  The considerations for repatriation of your workforce to the office following COVID 19 has been 
on the minds of most business owners across Iowa, the United States and the world.  In order to 

do so safely, we have to consider what changes must take place t
o protect the physical and 
mental wellbeing of our employees, contractors, vendors and visitors to each of our facilities.  
 We still face many challenges as we look forward to the next few weeks.  Lack of Personal 

Protective Equipment (PPE) for employees,
 shortage of testing for individuals, conflicting 

information on how we handle employees that have tested positive or have been given the 

diagnosis of a presumptive positive are all things that add a complex dynamic to bringing our 

workforce back.  
 We hav
e pulled together ma
ny different resources to provide a
 variety of businesses and 
organizations gui
dance as they address reopening.

   2  General Tips
  General Health Guidelines:
  Encourage staff and employees to take their temperature twice a day. Set a baseline 
temperature that, if exceeded, will deny entry to your facility.  Currently, the CDC has
 set 
the temperature of 100.4 as a guidepost for medical workers
.  Work with staff to encourage handwashing and using hand sanitizer every hour.
  Promote etiqu
ette for coughing, sneezing and handwashing. 
  Encourage staff to wear face masks
 for homemade cloth face mask to prevent the spread 
of COVID
-19.  General 
Reopening Guidance
:  Use 
CDC guidance related to 
cleaning and d
isinf
ection for community f
acilities
, including frequent cleaning and disinfecting of all high touch surfaces.
  Encourage
 and provide supplies to allow for frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing 
for employees and the public.
  Provide reminders to employees and members of the public to stay at least 6 feet away 

from others when in the facility and mark 
six
-foot
 intervals wh
en possible.
  Post signage at the door indicating no one should enter the establishment if they currently 

have
 symptoms
 or have been around anyone with a confirmed COVID
-19 diagnosis in 
the last 14 days.
  If an employee or a member of the public becomes ill 
while at the facility, ask them to 
share that information with management, leave the facility and then call their health care 
provider.
  Members of the public and employees should consider the use of 
cloth face coverings 
(when practical) if staying at least
 6 feet aw
ay from others is not possible.
   Anyone who is
 high risk
 for more severe COVID
-19 illnes
s should continue to stay 
home.
  Businesses should continue to follow 
IDPH™s business guidance related to preventing, 
detecting an
d reporting outbreaks.
  Busine
sses should use
 messaging 
to remind employees of steps they should be taking to 
protect their own health while at work.
      3  General Guidance for All Employees
   Employees should take and log temperature before shifts
 o Best practice: employers to take 
temperatures onsite with a no
-touch thermometer 
each day upon arrival at work.
 o Minimum: temperatures can be taken before arriving. Normal temperature should 
not exceed 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Employees should also be screened for COVID
-19 symptoms includ
ing: 
fever of 100°F 
or higher, cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle aches
, fatigue, diarrhea or vomiting
. Immediately exclude anyone with symptoms from entering.
  Staff should wear face coverings (not N
-95 or medical masks, 
which should be reserved 
for healthcare workers) and other personal protection items as recommended by the CDC.
  Provide training on personal protective equipment based on CDC guidelines.
  Staff will need to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer every hour.
  Practice recommended social distancing to the greatest extent possible
ŠﬁFurther is 

safer.ﬂ
  Stagger shifts, breaks and meals, in compliance with wage and hour laws and regulations, 

to maintain social distancing. Consider reduced staffing requirements where
 possible.
  Prohibit congregating in break rooms or common areas and limit capacity of such areas to 

allow for safe social distancing minimum of 6 feet whenever possible.
 o Employees should increase hygiene practices
Šwash hands more frequently, 
avoid touching
 face, practice good respiratory etiquette when coughing or 
sneezing.
  All employees should stay home if feeling ill, report any symptoms of illness to 

supervisor and require notification of COVID
-19 positive case in employee™s household. 
Employees who are 
particularly vulnerable to COVID
-19 according to the CDC (e.g., due 
to age or underlying conditions) are encouraged to stay home.
  Update the Employee Illness Policy to include the symptoms of ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ or create a 
COVID
-19 specific policy. All staff shoul
d sign the policy, and the policy should be 
posted for confirmation.
  Post extensive signage on health policies, including the following documents, in the 
workplace to help educate building occupants on COVID
-19 best practices.
       4   Workplace Leave 
Policies
   Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and 
that employees are aware of and understand these policies.
  Maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family 
member 
or take care of children due to school and childcare closures. Additional 
flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave and allowing employees 
to donate sick leave to each other.
  Employers that do not currently offer sick leave to some o
r all of their employees may 
want to draft non
-punitive ﬁemergency sick leaveﬂ policies.
  Employers should not require a positive COVID
-19 test result or a healthcare provider™s 
note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick lea
ve, or to 
return to work. Healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy 
and not able to provide such documentation in a timely manner.
  Review human resources policies to make sure that policies and practices are consistent 
with p
ublic health recommendations and are consistent with existing state and federal 
workplace laws (for more information on employer responsibilities, visit th
e Department 
of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website.  
  Connect employees to emp
loyee assistance program (EAP) resources (if available) and 
community resources as needed. Employees may need additional social, behavioral, and 
other services, for example, to cope with the death of a loved one.
        
    5   Cleaning and Disinfecting Your
 Facility
  Always w
ear gloves when cleaning and disinfecting
 Clean
  Clean surfaces using soap and water, then use disinfectant.
  Cleaning with soap and water
 reduces number of germs, dirt and impurities
 on the 
surface.
 Disinfecting kills germs
 on surfaces.
  Practice routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces.
 o More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use.
 o Surfaces and objects in public places, such as shopping carts and point of sale 
keypads should be clea
ned and disinfected before each use.
 Disinfect
  Recommend use of
 EPA
-registered household cleaners.
  Follow the instructions on the label
 to ensure safe and effective use of the product.
 Many products recommend:
 o Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see
 product label)
 o Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation 
during use of the product.
 o Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used
 if appropriate for the 
surface.
 o Check the label to see if your bleach is intended
 for disinfection, and ensure the 
product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for 
safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection.
 o Unexpired household bleach will be effective against co
ronaviruses when 
properly diluted.
 Follow manufacturer™s instructions
 for application and proper ventilation. Never 
mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.
 Leave solution
 on the surface for
 at least 1 minute.
  To make a bleach solution
, mix:
 o 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water
 OR o 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water
  Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.
  Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.
 6   Soft surfaces
 For soft sur
faces such as
 carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes
  Clean the surface using soap and water
 or with cleaners appropriate for use on these 
surfaces.
  Launder items
 (if possible) according to the manufacturer™s 
instructions. Use
 the 
warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely.
 OR  Disinfect with an EPA
-registered household disinfectant.
 These disinfectants
 meet 
EPA™s criteria for use against COVID
-19. Electronics
 For electronics, such as
 tablets, touch screens, 
keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines
  Consider putting a
 wipeable cover
 on electronics.
  Follow manufacturer™s instruction
 for cleaning and disinfecting.
 o If no guidance,
 use alcohol
-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol
. Dry surface 
thoroughly.
 Laundry
 For clothing, towels, linens and other items
:  Launder items according to the manufacturer™s instructions.
 Use the warmest 
appropriate water setting
 and dry items completely.
  Wear disposable gloves
 when handling dirty laundry from a 
person who is sick.
  Dirty laundry from a person who is sick
 can be washed with other people™s items
.  Do not shake
 dirty laundry.
  Clean and
 disinfect clothes hampers
 according to guidance above for surfaces.
  Remove gloves, and
 wash hands right away
.     7   Cleaning and disinfecting your building or facility if someone is sick
  Close off areas
 used by the person who is sick.
 o Companies do not necessarily need to close operations, if they can close off affected 
areas.
  Open outside doors and windows and use 
ventilating fans
 to increase air circulation in the 
area.
  Wait 24 hours
 before you clean or disinfect. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as 
possible.
  Clean and disinfect
 all areas used by the person who is sick
, such as offices, bathrooms, 
common a
reas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote 
controls, and ATM machines.
  Once area has been
 appropriately disinfected
, it
 can be opened for use
. o Workers without close contact
 with the person who is sick can return to wor
k immediately after disinfection.
  If more than 7 days
 since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional 
cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.
 o Continue routine cleaning and disinfection. This includes everyday practices that 
busine
sses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment.
 Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas
  Outdoor areas, like
 playgrounds in schools and parks
 generally require
 normal routine 
cleaning
, but do not require disinfection.
 o Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds
- it is not an efficient use of 
supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID
-19 to the public.
 o High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings 
should be cleaned routinely.
 o Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or 
groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended.
  Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected.
 o Spread of COVID
-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not 
effec
tive.
  8   When cleaning
  Regular cleaning staff
 can clean and disinfect community spaces.
 o Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals.
  Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including 
handling trash
. o Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the 
cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.
 o Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the 
wearer
 and the surrounding area.
  Wash your hands often
 with soap and water for 20 seconds.
 o Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person 
who is sick.
 o Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly di
rty, 
an alcohol
-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. 
However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.
  Additional key times to wash hands
 include:
 o After blowing one™s nose, coughing, or sneezing.
 o After using the restroom.
 o Before eating or preparing food.
 o After contact with animals or pets.
 o Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance 
(e.g., a child).
 Additional Considerations for Employers
  Educate workers
 performing
 cleaning, laundry, and trash pick
-up to recognize the 
symptoms of COVID
-19.  Ensure workers are
 trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals
 used in the 
workplace in accordance with OSHA™s Hazard Communication standard.
  Comply
 with OSHA™s standards on 
Bloodborne Pathogens), including proper disposal of 
regulated waste, and PPE.
 Alternative Disinfection Methods
  The efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity 
UV radiation, and LED blue light against COVID
-19 viru
s is not known.
 9  o EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as 
UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm 
whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against 
the spread of COVID
-19.  CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they 
are effective in reducing the spread of COVID
-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels 
could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.
  CDC only recommends use of the
 EPA approved cleaners
 against the virus that causes 
COVID
-19.     
       
       
  10   Industry Specific Reopening Guidelines
  Dining and Bars
 It is critical that restaurant personnel review, and restaurants 
must
 ensure the following 
mandatory requirements
 included in the governor™s proclamation are in place and enforced: 
   Limit indoor and outdoor seating capacity to 50 percent of normal operating capacity. 
  Limit group size to no more than six people. 
  Arrange se
ating to provide a minimum of six feet between tables. 
  Disallow customer self
-service of food or beverages, including buffets and salad bars. 
  Implement reasonable measures to ensure social distancing of employees and customers, 
increased hygiene practice
s, and other public health measures to reduce the risk of 

transmission of COVID
-19.   
Additionally, the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals and the Iowa Department of 

Public Health 
strongly recommend that all restaurants adhere to the following guid
ance
:    To the extent possible, eliminate seating at bars within restaurants. 
  Eliminate entertainment operations or activities. 
  Serve alcohol to a guest only if the guest is also ord
ering and consuming food items.
  Disinfect tables and chairs after each customer use. 
  Clean and sanitize table condiments, reusable menus, digital ordering devices, check 

presenters, pens, napkin dispensers, salt and pepper shakers, and other commonly
-touched items between each customer 
use. 
  Use prewrapped silverware and eliminate table presets including table tents, menus, salt 

and pepper shakers, napkin dispensers, and condiments. 
  Eliminate refilling customer beverages from common containers (i.e., pitchers). 
   Discard single
-use or p
aper articles, such as paper menus, after each use. 
  Create and implement an enhanced cleaning/sanitizing schedule for all food contact 

surfaces, and cleaning/disinfecting of non
-food contact surfaces. 
  Disinfect commonly
-touched surfaces throughout entire
 facility (both front and back
-of-house) such as door handles, credit card machines, bathrooms, etc., at least once every 

hour. 
  11    To the extent possible, on
-premises dining should be by reservation only and customers 
should be screened upon reservation an
d arrival as to whether anyone in the party is 
positive, has any symptoms, is under quarantine, or has been exposed to COVID
-19.   Post signage on entrance door that no one with a fever or symptoms of COVID
-19 will be 
permitted in the restaurant. 
  Screen al
l employees each shift before entering the facility for symptoms (i.e., fever of 
100°F or higher, cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle 

aches, fatigue, diarrhea, or vomiting). Immediately exclude anyone with symptoms from 

entering. 
  Where possible, workstations should be staggered to avoid employees standing directly 

opposite one another or next to each other, and maintain six feet of social distance.
  Require employees with direct customer contact to w
ear cloth or other mask 
that is 
laundered or replaced daily. 
  Frequently monitor employee handwashing and ensure no bare hand contact with ready
-to-eat foods. 
  Notify customers by signage to report concerns of social distancing infractions to the 
restaurant manager. 
  Use technolo
gical solutions where possible to reduce person
-to-person interaction (e.g. 
mobile ordering, mobile access to menus to plan in advance, text on arrival for seating, 
contactless payment options). 
  Enhance employee safety training, emphasizing employee healt
h, handwashing, and 
personal hygiene practices. 
  Have hand sanitizer and sanitizing products readily available for employees and 

customers. 
  Designate with signage, tape, or by other means appropriate social distancing spacing for 

employees and customers. 
Facilitate and designate social distancing for those waiting to 

enter your establishment. 
  If possible, provide distinct walking lanes to minimize close contact as customers are 

being seated to conform to social distancing practices. For example, in a tabl
e/booth 
layout, central tables can be removed, and markings can be installed designating the path 

for seating. 
  Assign an employee each shift to monitor social distancing, sanitation, and hygiene 

protocols.

before and after each us
e  Encourage customers to use only one piece of equipment at a time (i.e., no circuits or 

ﬁsuper settingﬂ) so that machines are cleaned after use
  Consider limiting workout length to avoid unnecessary exposure, decrease congestion, 

and allow for additional s
anitization
  Recommend that persons more vulnerable or at
-risk for  COVID
-19 as identified by the 
CDC
Šincluding those who are over the age of 65 or those who have chronic medical 
conditions
Štake extra precaution or refrain 
from use of the facility.
  
Busines
s Process Adaptations
  Restrict facility access to staffed hours only (i.e., any unmanned facilities must be 

manned) and limit facility occupancy to 50 percent of capacity as dictated by fire code 

(as such capacity is adjusted in consideration of closed are
as of the facility pursuant to 
these guidelines).
  Mitigate exposure in the workplace by implementing social distancing guidelines and 

modify scheduling.
  Staff to conduct regular (i.e., every 2 hours) disinfecting of high
-touch surfaces, 
equipment and commo
n areas of the facility using disinfectant cleaning supplies 
according to CDC guidelines.
  Close showers, locker rooms, and lockers until further notice. Ask customers to instead 
use small gym bags to store personal belongings; remind customers to appropria
tely 
monitor or secure such personal belongs or provide a secure area monitored by staff.
  Close all swimming pools, hot tubs, saunas and other recreational water or spa facilities.
  Close all basketball courts, racquetball courts, and other places where for
mal and 
informal group or team sports may occur.
  Any youth or adult team leagues or sports should remain closed.
 17   Only allow group fitness classes if classes can be completed in accordance with social 
distancing recommendations (including but not limited to
: less than 50% capacity and 
with more than 6 feet of distance maintained between participants at all times; no shared 
equipment during the class; sufficiently adjusted class schedules to allow for deep 
cleaning between classes; martial arts and other cont
act activities should be completed 
without any person
-to-person contact).
  Encourage all employees and customers to wear PPE where applicable, and recommend 

that customers wear a face covering (not N
-95 or medical masks, which should be 
reserved for healthc
are workers).
  Adjust equipment layout and close or restrict access to equipment to maintain at least six 
feet of distance between equipment.
  Temporarily close water fountains, common areas, break rooms, check
-in counters, 
where customers or employees may c
ongregate. Encourage users to provide their own 
water.
  No self
-service options (coffee bars, smoothie stations and other forms of communal food 
in facilities). Food retail should follow restaurant guidelines.
  Ensure that staffing of facilities is sufficien
t to enable enhanced sanitization and cleaning 
measures.
         
      18  Legal Considerations of ﬁBack to Workﬂ
  Generally Speaking:
 Employers may face liability under O
ccupational 
Safety and 
Health 
Administration (OSHA)
 regulations for actions taken before, during and after the COVID
-19 crisis.
 Although there is no 
ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ standard, several OSHA standards could be applied to preventing the spread of the 
disease.  This includes, but is not limited to, the ﬁGeneral Duty
 Clauseﬂ which requires 
employers to provide their workers ﬁ
employment and a place of employment, which are free 
from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ
 29 USC 654(a)(1)
 Though it would be difficult 
for an employee to clearly demonstrate that they contracted the 
illness while at their place of employment, contact tracing could lay a clear path back to the 

workplace.  
 As we begin to repatriate our offices and bring the workforce back, there are many a
dditional 
considerations that may impact decisions.  There is always a chance that employers may face 

claims of discrimination while making difficult choices in how they phase in the returning work 
force.  
It is impera
tive that such decisions are made for 
reasons
 not based on a protected cl
ass as 
defined by
 discrimination laws. 
Specifically, employers need to
 careful
ly document their 
selection process and avoid making any 
decisions based on
 age or disabilities that might be 
perceived to 
make an employee or 
applicant more vulnerable to the virus.
 For businesses that are forced to make a reduction in work force, these same types of 

considerations should be applied.  Employees that used sick leave to care for family members or 

because of concerns about their ow
n well
-being that are later part of a force reduction may 
consider this a retaliation or retribution by the employer.  
 Personal Protective Equipment:
 Many employers are considering placement of policies or protocols that include the wearing of 

facemasks, 
gloves or other protective equipment to help stop the spread of any illness in their 
workplace.  
While the intent is well placed, certain considerations should be made:
  Have you accounted for those with access and functional needs?  This may include things
 like protective wear for those who use wheelchairs, options for those with allergies to 
latex, etc.  
  Have you provided proper training for use of the protective wear? Improper donning and 
doffing of protective equipment is often the cause of infection am
ong medical 
professionals.  
  Can you provide fit testing for masks?  
 Legally, if the employer can accommodate these types of exceptions or alternatives without 
causing undue hardship to the business, they are required to do so.  
 19   Screening and other 
access controls
 Even those things that are intende
d to protect the work force may cause legal issues if not 
completed correctly.  Currently, under the medical emergency, leniencies have been provided 
to companies in the interest of protecting the general p
ublic from COVID
-19. As the disaster continues and a new normal emerges, there may be a review of these 
procedures which may cause problems if not implemented correctly.
 Some basic steps may help to protect companies:
 1. Decide who
 you will screen.  While some companies are screening ALL employees, 
others are screening only those who have been in contact with someone who has been 
tested positive for COVID 19.  Many companies are testing everyone who enters the 
facility while others 
do not have that option (retail stores and others with rotating 
customer base where it would be impractical).  One of the most important considerations 
is consistency and assurance that the testing is completed on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 2. Training for th
ose who are doing the screening.  Again, there are differences in how 
companies are doing the screening.  Some companies are allowing employees to take 
their own temperature while others are providing a trained employee to take all 

temperatures.  Still oth
ers are hiring third party contractors for this purpose.  Whichever 
method you choose, maintain records to ensure discrimination has not taken place. 
 3. Safety Concerns and Requirements.  Ensure that those taking temperatures are provided 
proper personal pro
tective equipment.
 4. Equipment.  Consider what type of thermometers will be used and be consistent.  Speed, 
accuracy and ease of use are main considerations for most of the businesses 
implementing checks.  
 5. Decide where checks will take place.  The main cons
ideration is privacy.  The best 
location would allow some discretion for the person being screened.  Ideally, there would 
be an alternate location that anyone failing the screening could be taken to walk them 
though the next steps.
 6. Develop a screening proc
ess or policy and stick to it. 
 7. Develop a documentation process.
 8. Communicate the processes to your employees prior to implementation.
 9. Send employees home if they have a fever or if they refuse to be tested.  Communicate 
this to employees prior to beginning
 the testing process.  If an employee is sent home, 
provide them with instructions or expectations (call their primary care provider, get tested 

if possible, etc.)
.  Follow up periodically with employees that are sent home.
 10. Establish return to work procedu
re and communicate that with employees.  Written 

policy should be sent with anyone that is sent home.  Some considerations may include:
 a. Cannot return to work unless at least 10 days has passed since onset of symptoms
 b. Cannot return to work until at least 72
 hours after employee has experienced no 
fever
 20  c. Has been completely symptom free for at least 72 hours. 
 Legal implications related to the return to the office are endless.  The protection of employer and 
employee are mutually beneficial and both need to be
 considered for a successful restart of our 
companies and our economy.  
It™s important to actively engage your legal department or other 
counsel early in your processes.

Back t
o Work Considerations
  The considerations for repatriation of your workforce to the office following COVID 19 has been 
on the minds of most business owners across Iowa, the United States and the world.  In order to 

do so safely, we have to consider what changes must take place t
o protect the physical and 
mental wellbeing of our employees, contractors, vendors and visitors to each of our facilities.  
 We still face many challenges as we look forward to the next few weeks.  Lack of Personal 

Protective Equipment (PPE) for employees,
 shortage of testing for individuals, conflicting 

information on how we handle employees that have tested positive or have been given the 

diagnosis of a presumptive positive are all things that add a complex dynamic to bringing our 

workforce back.  
 We hav
e pulled together ma
ny different resources to provide a
 variety of businesses and 
organizations gui
dance as they address reopening.

   2  General Tips
  General Health Guidelines:
  Encourage staff and employees to take their temperature twice a day. Set a baseline 
temperature that, if exceeded, will deny entry to your facility.  Currently, the CDC has
 set 
the temperature of 100.4 as a guidepost for medical workers
.  Work with staff to encourage handwashing and using hand sanitizer every hour.
  Promote etiqu
ette for coughing, sneezing and handwashing. 
  Encourage staff to wear face masks
 for homemade cloth face mask to prevent the spread 
of COVID
-19.  General 
Reopening Guidance
:  Use 
CDC guidance related to 
cleaning and d
isinf
ection for community f
acilities
, including frequent cleaning and disinfecting of all high touch surfaces.
  Encourage
 and provide supplies to allow for frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing 
for employees and the public.
  Provide reminders to employees and members of the public to stay at least 6 feet away 

from others when in the facility and mark 
six
-foot
 intervals wh
en possible.
  Post signage at the door indicating no one should enter the establishment if they currently 

have
 symptoms
 or have been around anyone with a confirmed COVID
-19 diagnosis in 
the last 14 days.
  If an employee or a member of the public becomes ill 
while at the facility, ask them to 
share that information with management, leave the facility and then call their health care 
provider.
  Members of the public and employees should consider the use of 
cloth face coverings 
(when practical) if staying at least
 6 feet aw
ay from others is not possible.
   Anyone who is
 high risk
 for more severe COVID
-19 illnes
s should continue to stay 
home.
  Businesses should continue to follow 
IDPH™s business guidance related to preventing, 
detecting an
d reporting outbreaks.
  Busine
sses should use
 messaging 
to remind employees of steps they should be taking to 
protect their own health while at work.
      3  General Guidance for All Employees
   Employees should take and log temperature before shifts
 o Best practice: employers to take 
temperatures onsite with a no
-touch thermometer 
each day upon arrival at work.
 o Minimum: temperatures can be taken before arriving. Normal temperature should 
not exceed 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Employees should also be screened for COVID
-19 symptoms includ
ing: 
fever of 100°F 
or higher, cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle aches
, fatigue, diarrhea or vomiting
. Immediately exclude anyone with symptoms from entering.
  Staff should wear face coverings (not N
-95 or medical masks, 
which should be reserved 
for healthcare workers) and other personal protection items as recommended by the CDC.
  Provide training on personal protective equipment based on CDC guidelines.
  Staff will need to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer every hour.
  Practice recommended social distancing to the greatest extent possible
ŠﬁFurther is 

safer.ﬂ
  Stagger shifts, breaks and meals, in compliance with wage and hour laws and regulations, 

to maintain social distancing. Consider reduced staffing requirements where
 possible.
  Prohibit congregating in break rooms or common areas and limit capacity of such areas to 

allow for safe social distancing minimum of 6 feet whenever possible.
 o Employees should increase hygiene practices
Šwash hands more frequently, 
avoid touching
 face, practice good respiratory etiquette when coughing or 
sneezing.
  All employees should stay home if feeling ill, report any symptoms of illness to 

supervisor and require notification of COVID
-19 positive case in employee™s household. 
Employees who are 
particularly vulnerable to COVID
-19 according to the CDC (e.g., due 
to age or underlying conditions) are encouraged to stay home.
  Update the Employee Illness Policy to include the symptoms of ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ or create a 
COVID
-19 specific policy. All staff shoul
d sign the policy, and the policy should be 
posted for confirmation.
  Post extensive signage on health policies, including the following documents, in the 
workplace to help educate building occupants on COVID
-19 best practices.
       4   Workplace Leave 
Policies
   Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and 
that employees are aware of and understand these policies.
  Maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family 
member 
or take care of children due to school and childcare closures. Additional 
flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave and allowing employees 
to donate sick leave to each other.
  Employers that do not currently offer sick leave to some o
r all of their employees may 
want to draft non
-punitive ﬁemergency sick leaveﬂ policies.
  Employers should not require a positive COVID
-19 test result or a healthcare provider™s 
note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick lea
ve, or to 
return to work. Healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy 
and not able to provide such documentation in a timely manner.
  Review human resources policies to make sure that policies and practices are consistent 
with p
ublic health recommendations and are consistent with existing state and federal 
workplace laws (for more information on employer responsibilities, visit th
e Department 
of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website.  
  Connect employees to emp
loyee assistance program (EAP) resources (if available) and 
community resources as needed. Employees may need additional social, behavioral, and 
other services, for example, to cope with the death of a loved one.
        
    5   Cleaning and Disinfecting Your
 Facility
  Always w
ear gloves when cleaning and disinfecting
 Clean
  Clean surfaces using soap and water, then use disinfectant.
  Cleaning with soap and water
 reduces number of germs, dirt and impurities
 on the 
surface.
 Disinfecting kills germs
 on surfaces.
  Practice routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces.
 o More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use.
 o Surfaces and objects in public places, such as shopping carts and point of sale 
keypads should be clea
ned and disinfected before each use.
 Disinfect
  Recommend use of
 EPA
-registered household cleaners.
  Follow the instructions on the label
 to ensure safe and effective use of the product.
 Many products recommend:
 o Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see
 product label)
 o Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation 
during use of the product.
 o Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used
 if appropriate for the 
surface.
 o Check the label to see if your bleach is intended
 for disinfection, and ensure the 
product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for 
safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection.
 o Unexpired household bleach will be effective against co
ronaviruses when 
properly diluted.
 Follow manufacturer™s instructions
 for application and proper ventilation. Never 
mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.
 Leave solution
 on the surface for
 at least 1 minute.
  To make a bleach solution
, mix:
 o 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water
 OR o 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water
  Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.
  Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.
 6   Soft surfaces
 For soft sur
faces such as
 carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes
  Clean the surface using soap and water
 or with cleaners appropriate for use on these 
surfaces.
  Launder items
 (if possible) according to the manufacturer™s 
instructions. Use
 the 
warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely.
 OR  Disinfect with an EPA
-registered household disinfectant.
 These disinfectants
 meet 
EPA™s criteria for use against COVID
-19. Electronics
 For electronics, such as
 tablets, touch screens, 
keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines
  Consider putting a
 wipeable cover
 on electronics.
  Follow manufacturer™s instruction
 for cleaning and disinfecting.
 o If no guidance,
 use alcohol
-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol
. Dry surface 
thoroughly.
 Laundry
 For clothing, towels, linens and other items
:  Launder items according to the manufacturer™s instructions.
 Use the warmest 
appropriate water setting
 and dry items completely.
  Wear disposable gloves
 when handling dirty laundry from a 
person who is sick.
  Dirty laundry from a person who is sick
 can be washed with other people™s items
.  Do not shake
 dirty laundry.
  Clean and
 disinfect clothes hampers
 according to guidance above for surfaces.
  Remove gloves, and
 wash hands right away
.     7   Cleaning and disinfecting your building or facility if someone is sick
  Close off areas
 used by the person who is sick.
 o Companies do not necessarily need to close operations, if they can close off affected 
areas.
  Open outside doors and windows and use 
ventilating fans
 to increase air circulation in the 
area.
  Wait 24 hours
 before you clean or disinfect. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as 
possible.
  Clean and disinfect
 all areas used by the person who is sick
, such as offices, bathrooms, 
common a
reas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote 
controls, and ATM machines.
  Once area has been
 appropriately disinfected
, it
 can be opened for use
. o Workers without close contact
 with the person who is sick can return to wor
k immediately after disinfection.
  If more than 7 days
 since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional 
cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.
 o Continue routine cleaning and disinfection. This includes everyday practices that 
busine
sses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment.
 Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas
  Outdoor areas, like
 playgrounds in schools and parks
 generally require
 normal routine 
cleaning
, but do not require disinfection.
 o Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds
- it is not an efficient use of 
supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID
-19 to the public.
 o High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings 
should be cleaned routinely.
 o Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or 
groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended.
  Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected.
 o Spread of COVID
-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not 
effec
tive.
  8   When cleaning
  Regular cleaning staff
 can clean and disinfect community spaces.
 o Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals.
  Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including 
handling trash
. o Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the 
cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.
 o Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the 
wearer
 and the surrounding area.
  Wash your hands often
 with soap and water for 20 seconds.
 o Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person 
who is sick.
 o Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly di
rty, 
an alcohol
-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. 
However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.
  Additional key times to wash hands
 include:
 o After blowing one™s nose, coughing, or sneezing.
 o After using the restroom.
 o Before eating or preparing food.
 o After contact with animals or pets.
 o Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance 
(e.g., a child).
 Additional Considerations for Employers
  Educate workers
 performing
 cleaning, laundry, and trash pick
-up to recognize the 
symptoms of COVID
-19.  Ensure workers are
 trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals
 used in the 
workplace in accordance with OSHA™s Hazard Communication standard.
  Comply
 with OSHA™s standards on 
Bloodborne Pathogens), including proper disposal of 
regulated waste, and PPE.
 Alternative Disinfection Methods
  The efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity 
UV radiation, and LED blue light against COVID
-19 viru
s is not known.
 9  o EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as 
UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm 
whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against 
the spread of COVID
-19.  CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they 
are effective in reducing the spread of COVID
-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels 
could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.
  CDC only recommends use of the
 EPA approved cleaners
 against the virus that causes 
COVID
-19.     
       
       
  10   Industry Specific Reopening Guidelines
  Dining and Bars
 It is critical that restaurant personnel review, and restaurants 
must
 ensure the following 
mandatory requirements
 included in the governor™s proclamation are in place and enforced: 
   Limit indoor and outdoor seating capacity to 50 percent of normal operating capacity. 
  Limit group size to no more than six people. 
  Arrange se
ating to provide a minimum of six feet between tables. 
  Disallow customer self
-service of food or beverages, including buffets and salad bars. 
  Implement reasonable measures to ensure social distancing of employees and customers, 
increased hygiene practice
s, and other public health measures to reduce the risk of 

transmission of COVID
-19.   
Additionally, the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals and the Iowa Department of 

Public Health 
strongly recommend that all restaurants adhere to the following guid
ance
:    To the extent possible, eliminate seating at bars within restaurants. 
  Eliminate entertainment operations or activities. 
  Serve alcohol to a guest only if the guest is also ord
ering and consuming food items.
  Disinfect tables and chairs after each customer use. 
  Clean and sanitize table condiments, reusable menus, digital ordering devices, check 

presenters, pens, napkin dispensers, salt and pepper shakers, and other commonly
-touched items between each customer 
use. 
  Use prewrapped silverware and eliminate table presets including table tents, menus, salt 

and pepper shakers, napkin dispensers, and condiments. 
  Eliminate refilling customer beverages from common containers (i.e., pitchers). 
   Discard single
-use or p
aper articles, such as paper menus, after each use. 
  Create and implement an enhanced cleaning/sanitizing schedule for all food contact 

surfaces, and cleaning/disinfecting of non
-food contact surfaces. 
  Disinfect commonly
-touched surfaces throughout entire
 facility (both front and back
-of-house) such as door handles, credit card machines, bathrooms, etc., at least once every 

hour. 
  11    To the extent possible, on
-premises dining should be by reservation only and customers 
should be screened upon reservation an
d arrival as to whether anyone in the party is 
positive, has any symptoms, is under quarantine, or has been exposed to COVID
-19.   Post signage on entrance door that no one with a fever or symptoms of COVID
-19 will be 
permitted in the restaurant. 
  Screen al
l employees each shift before entering the facility for symptoms (i.e., fever of 
100°F or higher, cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle 

aches, fatigue, diarrhea, or vomiting). Immediately exclude anyone with symptoms from 

entering. 
  Where possible, workstations should be staggered to avoid employees standing directly 

opposite one another or next to each other, and maintain six feet of social distance.
  Require employees with direct customer contact to w
ear cloth or other mask 
that is 
laundered or replaced daily. 
  Frequently monitor employee handwashing and ensure no bare hand contact with ready
-to-eat foods. 
  Notify customers by signage to report concerns of social distancing infractions to the 
restaurant manager. 
  Use technolo
gical solutions where possible to reduce person
-to-person interaction (e.g. 
mobile ordering, mobile access to menus to plan in advance, text on arrival for seating, 
contactless payment options). 
  Enhance employee safety training, emphasizing employee healt
h, handwashing, and 
personal hygiene practices. 
  Have hand sanitizer and sanitizing products readily available for employees and 

customers. 
  Designate with signage, tape, or by other means appropriate social distancing spacing for 

employees and customers. 
Facilitate and designate social distancing for those waiting to 

enter your establishment. 
  If possible, provide distinct walking lanes to minimize close contact as customers are 

being seated to conform to social distancing practices. For example, in a tabl
e/booth 
layout, central tables can be removed, and markings can be installed designating the path 

for seating. 
  Assign an employee each shift to monitor social distancing, sanitation, and hygiene 

protocols.

Busines
s Process Adaptations
  Restrict facility access to staffed hours only (i.e., any unmanned facilities must be 

manned) and limit facility occupancy to 50 percent of capacity as dictated by fire code 

(as such capacity is adjusted in consideration of closed are
as of the facility pursuant to 
these guidelines).
  Mitigate exposure in the workplace by implementing social distancing guidelines and 

modify scheduling.
  Staff to conduct regular (i.e., every 2 hours) disinfecting of high
-touch surfaces, 
equipment and commo
n areas of the facility using disinfectant cleaning supplies 
according to CDC guidelines.
  Close showers, locker rooms, and lockers until further notice. Ask customers to instead 
use small gym bags to store personal belongings; remind customers to appropria
tely 
monitor or secure such personal belongs or provide a secure area monitored by staff.
  Close all swimming pools, hot tubs, saunas and other recreational water or spa facilities.
  Close all basketball courts, racquetball courts, and other places where for
mal and 
informal group or team sports may occur.
  Any youth or adult team leagues or sports should remain closed.
 17   Only allow group fitness classes if classes can be completed in accordance with social 
distancing recommendations (including but not limited to
: less than 50% capacity and 
with more than 6 feet of distance maintained between participants at all times; no shared 
equipment during the class; sufficiently adjusted class schedules to allow for deep 
cleaning between classes; martial arts and other cont
act activities should be completed 
without any person
-to-person contact).
  Encourage all employees and customers to wear PPE where applicable, and recommend 

that customers wear a face covering (not N
-95 or medical masks, which should be 
reserved for healthc
are workers).
  Adjust equipment layout and close or restrict access to equipment to maintain at least six 
feet of distance between equipment.
  Temporarily close water fountains, common areas, break rooms, check
-in counters, 
where customers or employees may c
ongregate. Encourage users to provide their own 
water.
  No self
-service options (coffee bars, smoothie stations and other forms of communal food 
in facilities). Food retail should follow restaurant guidelines.
  Ensure that staffing of facilities is sufficien
t to enable enhanced sanitization and cleaning 
measures.
         
      18  Legal Considerations of ﬁBack to Workﬂ
  Generally Speaking:
 Employers may face liability under O
ccupational 
Safety and 
Health 
Administration (OSHA)
 regulations for actions taken before, during and after the COVID
-19 crisis.
 Although there is no 
ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ standard, several OSHA standards could be applied to preventing the spread of the 
disease.  This includes, but is not limited to, the ﬁGeneral Duty
 Clauseﬂ which requires 
employers to provide their workers ﬁ
employment and a place of employment, which are free 
from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ
 29 USC 654(a)(1)
 Though it would be difficult 
for an employee to clearly demonstrate that they contracted the 
illness while at their place of employment, contact tracing could lay a clear path back to the 

workplace.  
 As we begin to repatriate our offices and bring the workforce back, there are many a
dditional 
considerations that may impact decisions.  There is always a chance that employers may face 

claims of discrimination while making difficult choices in how they phase in the returning work 
force.  
It is impera
tive that such decisions are made for 
reasons
 not based on a protected cl
ass as 
defined by
 discrimination laws. 
Specifically, employers need to
 careful
ly document their 
selection process and avoid making any 
decisions based on
 age or disabilities that might be 
perceived to 
make an employee or 
applicant more vulnerable to the virus.
 For businesses that are forced to make a reduction in work force, these same types of 

considerations should be applied.  Employees that used sick leave to care for family members or 

because of concerns about their ow
n well
-being that are later part of a force reduction may 
consider this a retaliation or retribution by the employer.  
 Personal Protective Equipment:
 Many employers are considering placement of policies or protocols that include the wearing of 

facemasks, 
gloves or other protective equipment to help stop the spread of any illness in their 
workplace.  
While the intent is well placed, certain considerations should be made:
  Have you accounted for those with access and functional needs?  This may include things
 like protective wear for those who use wheelchairs, options for those with allergies to 
latex, etc.  
  Have you provided proper training for use of the protective wear? Improper donning and 
doffing of protective equipment is often the cause of infection am
ong medical 
professionals.  
  Can you provide fit testing for masks?  
 Legally, if the employer can accommodate these types of exceptions or alternatives without 
causing undue hardship to the business, they are required to do so.  
 19   Screening and other 
access controls
 Even those things that are intende
d to protect the work force may cause legal issues if not 
completed correctly.  Currently, under the medical emergency, leniencies have been provided 
to companies in the interest of protecting the general p
ublic from COVID
-19. As the disaster continues and a new normal emerges, there may be a review of these 
procedures which may cause problems if not implemented correctly.
 Some basic steps may help to protect companies:
 1. Decide who
 you will screen.  While some companies are screening ALL employees, 
others are screening only those who have been in contact with someone who has been 
tested positive for COVID 19.  Many companies are testing everyone who enters the 
facility while others 
do not have that option (retail stores and others with rotating 
customer base where it would be impractical).  One of the most important considerations 
is consistency and assurance that the testing is completed on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 2. Training for th
ose who are doing the screening.  Again, there are differences in how 
companies are doing the screening.  Some companies are allowing employees to take 
their own temperature while others are providing a trained employee to take all 

temperatures.  Still oth
ers are hiring third party contractors for this purpose.  Whichever 
method you choose, maintain records to ensure discrimination has not taken place. 
 3. Safety Concerns and Requirements.  Ensure that those taking temperatures are provided 
proper personal pro
tective equipment.
 4. Equipment.  Consider what type of thermometers will be used and be consistent.  Speed, 
accuracy and ease of use are main considerations for most of the businesses 
implementing checks.  
 5. Decide where checks will take place.  The main cons
ideration is privacy.  The best 
location would allow some discretion for the person being screened.  Ideally, there would 
be an alternate location that anyone failing the screening could be taken to walk them 
though the next steps.
 6. Develop a screening proc
ess or policy and stick to it. 
 7. Develop a documentation process.
 8. Communicate the processes to your employees prior to implementation.
 9. Send employees home if they have a fever or if they refuse to be tested.  Communicate 
this to employees prior to beginning
 the testing process.  If an employee is sent home, 
provide them with instructions or expectations (call their primary care provider, get tested 

if possible, etc.)
.  Follow up periodically with employees that are sent home.
 10. Establish return to work procedu
re and communicate that with employees.  Written 

policy should be sent with anyone that is sent home.  Some considerations may include:
 a. Cannot return to work unless at least 10 days has passed since onset of symptoms
 b. Cannot return to work until at least 72
 hours after employee has experienced no 
fever
 20  c. Has been completely symptom free for at least 72 hours. 
 Legal implications related to the return to the office are endless.  The protection of employer and 
employee are mutually beneficial and both need to be
 considered for a successful restart of our 
companies and our economy.  
It™s important to actively engage your legal department or other 
counsel early in your processes.

Back t
o Work Considerations
  The considerations for repatriation of your workforce to the office following COVID 19 has been 
on the minds of most business owners across Iowa, the United States and the world.  In order to 

do so safely, we have to consider what changes must take place t
o protect the physical and 
mental wellbeing of our employees, contractors, vendors and visitors to each of our facilities.  
 We still face many challenges as we look forward to the next few weeks.  Lack of Personal 

Protective Equipment (PPE) for employees,
 shortage of testing for individuals, conflicting 

information on how we handle employees that have tested positive or have been given the 

diagnosis of a presumptive positive are all things that add a complex dynamic to bringing our 

workforce back.  
 We hav
e pulled together ma
ny different resources to provide a
 variety of businesses and 
organizations gui
dance as they address reopening.

   2  General Tips
  General Health Guidelines:
  Encourage staff and employees to take their temperature twice a day. Set a baseline 
temperature that, if exceeded, will deny entry to your facility.  Currently, the CDC has
 set 
the temperature of 100.4 as a guidepost for medical workers
.  Work with staff to encourage handwashing and using hand sanitizer every hour.
  Promote etiqu
ette for coughing, sneezing and handwashing. 
  Encourage staff to wear face masks
 for homemade cloth face mask to prevent the spread 
of COVID
-19.  General 
Reopening Guidance
:  Use 
CDC guidance related to 
cleaning and d
isinf
ection for community f
acilities
, including frequent cleaning and disinfecting of all high touch surfaces.
  Encourage
 and provide supplies to allow for frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing 
for employees and the public.
  Provide reminders to employees and members of the public to stay at least 6 feet away 

from others when in the facility and mark 
six
-foot
 intervals wh
en possible.
  Post signage at the door indicating no one should enter the establishment if they currently 

have
 symptoms
 or have been around anyone with a confirmed COVID
-19 diagnosis in 
the last 14 days.
  If an employee or a member of the public becomes ill 
while at the facility, ask them to 
share that information with management, leave the facility and then call their health care 
provider.
  Members of the public and employees should consider the use of 
cloth face coverings 
(when practical) if staying at least
 6 feet aw
ay from others is not possible.
   Anyone who is
 high risk
 for more severe COVID
-19 illnes
s should continue to stay 
home.
  Businesses should continue to follow 
IDPH™s business guidance related to preventing, 
detecting an
d reporting outbreaks.
  Busine
sses should use
 messaging 
to remind employees of steps they should be taking to 
protect their own health while at work.
      3  General Guidance for All Employees
   Employees should take and log temperature before shifts
 o Best practice: employers to take 
temperatures onsite with a no
-touch thermometer 
each day upon arrival at work.
 o Minimum: temperatures can be taken before arriving. Normal temperature should 
not exceed 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Employees should also be screened for COVID
-19 symptoms includ
ing: 
fever of 100°F 
or higher, cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle aches
, fatigue, diarrhea or vomiting
. Immediately exclude anyone with symptoms from entering.
  Staff should wear face coverings (not N
-95 or medical masks, 
which should be reserved 
for healthcare workers) and other personal protection items as recommended by the CDC.
  Provide training on personal protective equipment based on CDC guidelines.
  Staff will need to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer every hour.
  Practice recommended social distancing to the greatest extent possible
ŠﬁFurther is 

safer.ﬂ
  Stagger shifts, breaks and meals, in compliance with wage and hour laws and regulations, 

to maintain social distancing. Consider reduced staffing requirements where
 possible.
  Prohibit congregating in break rooms or common areas and limit capacity of such areas to 

allow for safe social distancing minimum of 6 feet whenever possible.
 o Employees should increase hygiene practices
Šwash hands more frequently, 
avoid touching
 face, practice good respiratory etiquette when coughing or 
sneezing.
  All employees should stay home if feeling ill, report any symptoms of illness to 

supervisor and require notification of COVID
-19 positive case in employee™s household. 
Employees who are 
particularly vulnerable to COVID
-19 according to the CDC (e.g., due 
to age or underlying conditions) are encouraged to stay home.
  Update the Employee Illness Policy to include the symptoms of ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ or create a 
COVID
-19 specific policy. All staff shoul
d sign the policy, and the policy should be 
posted for confirmation.
  Post extensive signage on health policies, including the following documents, in the 
workplace to help educate building occupants on COVID
-19 best practices.
       4   Workplace Leave 
Policies
   Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and 
that employees are aware of and understand these policies.
  Maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family 
member 
or take care of children due to school and childcare closures. Additional 
flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave and allowing employees 
to donate sick leave to each other.
  Employers that do not currently offer sick leave to some o
r all of their employees may 
want to draft non
-punitive ﬁemergency sick leaveﬂ policies.
  Employers should not require a positive COVID
-19 test result or a healthcare provider™s 
note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick lea
ve, or to 
return to work. Healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy 
and not able to provide such documentation in a timely manner.
  Review human resources policies to make sure that policies and practices are consistent 
with p
ublic health recommendations and are consistent with existing state and federal 
workplace laws (for more information on employer responsibilities, visit th
e Department 
of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website.  
  Connect employees to emp
loyee assistance program (EAP) resources (if available) and 
community resources as needed. Employees may need additional social, behavioral, and 
other services, for example, to cope with the death of a loved one.
        
    5   Cleaning and Disinfecting Your
 Facility
  Always w
ear gloves when cleaning and disinfecting
 Clean
  Clean surfaces using soap and water, then use disinfectant.
  Cleaning with soap and water
 reduces number of germs, dirt and impurities
 on the 
surface.
 Disinfecting kills germs
 on surfaces.
  Practice routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces.
 o More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use.
 o Surfaces and objects in public places, such as shopping carts and point of sale 
keypads should be clea
ned and disinfected before each use.
 Disinfect
  Recommend use of
 EPA
-registered household cleaners.
  Follow the instructions on the label
 to ensure safe and effective use of the product.
 Many products recommend:
 o Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see
 product label)
 o Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation 
during use of the product.
 o Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used
 if appropriate for the 
surface.
 o Check the label to see if your bleach is intended
 for disinfection, and ensure the 
product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for 
safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection.
 o Unexpired household bleach will be effective against co
ronaviruses when 
properly diluted.
 Follow manufacturer™s instructions
 for application and proper ventilation. Never 
mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.
 Leave solution
 on the surface for
 at least 1 minute.
  To make a bleach solution
, mix:
 o 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water
 OR o 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water
  Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.
  Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.
 6   Soft surfaces
 For soft sur
faces such as
 carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes
  Clean the surface using soap and water
 or with cleaners appropriate for use on these 
surfaces.
  Launder items
 (if possible) according to the manufacturer™s 
instructions. Use
 the 
warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely.
 OR  Disinfect with an EPA
-registered household disinfectant.
 These disinfectants
 meet 
EPA™s criteria for use against COVID
-19. Electronics
 For electronics, such as
 tablets, touch screens, 
keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines
  Consider putting a
 wipeable cover
 on electronics.
  Follow manufacturer™s instruction
 for cleaning and disinfecting.
 o If no guidance,
 use alcohol
-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol
. Dry surface 
thoroughly.
 Laundry
 For clothing, towels, linens and other items
:  Launder items according to the manufacturer™s instructions.
 Use the warmest 
appropriate water setting
 and dry items completely.
  Wear disposable gloves
 when handling dirty laundry from a 
person who is sick.
  Dirty laundry from a person who is sick
 can be washed with other people™s items
.  Do not shake
 dirty laundry.
  Clean and
 disinfect clothes hampers
 according to guidance above for surfaces.
  Remove gloves, and
 wash hands right away
.     7   Cleaning and disinfecting your building or facility if someone is sick
  Close off areas
 used by the person who is sick.
 o Companies do not necessarily need to close operations, if they can close off affected 
areas.
  Open outside doors and windows and use 
ventilating fans
 to increase air circulation in the 
area.
  Wait 24 hours
 before you clean or disinfect. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as 
possible.
  Clean and disinfect
 all areas used by the person who is sick
, such as offices, bathrooms, 
common a
reas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote 
controls, and ATM machines.
  Once area has been
 appropriately disinfected
, it
 can be opened for use
. o Workers without close contact
 with the person who is sick can return to wor
k immediately after disinfection.
  If more than 7 days
 since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional 
cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.
 o Continue routine cleaning and disinfection. This includes everyday practices that 
busine
sses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment.
 Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas
  Outdoor areas, like
 playgrounds in schools and parks
 generally require
 normal routine 
cleaning
, but do not require disinfection.
 o Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds
- it is not an efficient use of 
supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID
-19 to the public.
 o High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings 
should be cleaned routinely.
 o Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or 
groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended.
  Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected.
 o Spread of COVID
-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not 
effec
tive.
  8   When cleaning
  Regular cleaning staff
 can clean and disinfect community spaces.
 o Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals.
  Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including 
handling trash
. o Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the 
cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.
 o Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the 
wearer
 and the surrounding area.
  Wash your hands often
 with soap and water for 20 seconds.
 o Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person 
who is sick.
 o Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly di
rty, 
an alcohol
-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. 
However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.
  Additional key times to wash hands
 include:
 o After blowing one™s nose, coughing, or sneezing.
 o After using the restroom.
 o Before eating or preparing food.
 o After contact with animals or pets.
 o Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance 
(e.g., a child).
 Additional Considerations for Employers
  Educate workers
 performing
 cleaning, laundry, and trash pick
-up to recognize the 
symptoms of COVID
-19.  Ensure workers are
 trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals
 used in the 
workplace in accordance with OSHA™s Hazard Communication standard.
  Comply
 with OSHA™s standards on 
Bloodborne Pathogens), including proper disposal of 
regulated waste, and PPE.
 Alternative Disinfection Methods
  The efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity 
UV radiation, and LED blue light against COVID
-19 viru
s is not known.
 9  o EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as 
UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm 
whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against 
the spread of COVID
-19.  CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they 
are effective in reducing the spread of COVID
-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels 
could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.
  CDC only recommends use of the
 EPA approved cleaners
 against the virus that causes 
COVID
-19.     
       
       
  10   Industry Specific Reopening Guidelines
  Dining and Bars
 It is critical that restaurant personnel review, and restaurants 
must
 ensure the following 
mandatory requirements
 included in the governor™s proclamation are in place and enforced: 
   Limit indoor and outdoor seating capacity to 50 percent of normal operating capacity. 
  Limit group size to no more than six people. 
  Arrange se
ating to provide a minimum of six feet between tables. 
  Disallow customer self
-service of food or beverages, including buffets and salad bars. 
  Implement reasonable measures to ensure social distancing of employees and customers, 
increased hygiene practice
s, and other public health measures to reduce the risk of 

transmission of COVID
-19.   
Additionally, the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals and the Iowa Department of 

Public Health 
strongly recommend that all restaurants adhere to the following guid
ance
:    To the extent possible, eliminate seating at bars within restaurants. 
  Eliminate entertainment operations or activities. 
  Serve alcohol to a guest only if the guest is also ord
ering and consuming food items.
  Disinfect tables and chairs after each customer use. 
  Clean and sanitize table condiments, reusable menus, digital ordering devices, check 

presenters, pens, napkin dispensers, salt and pepper shakers, and other commonly
-touched items between each customer 
use. 
  Use prewrapped silverware and eliminate table presets including table tents, menus, salt 

and pepper shakers, napkin dispensers, and condiments. 
  Eliminate refilling customer beverages from common containers (i.e., pitchers). 
   Discard single
-use or p
aper articles, such as paper menus, after each use. 
  Create and implement an enhanced cleaning/sanitizing schedule for all food contact 

surfaces, and cleaning/disinfecting of non
-food contact surfaces. 
  Disinfect commonly
-touched surfaces throughout entire
 facility (both front and back
-of-house) such as door handles, credit card machines, bathrooms, etc., at least once every 

hour. 
  11    To the extent possible, on
-premises dining should be by reservation only and customers 
should be screened upon reservation an
d arrival as to whether anyone in the party is 
positive, has any symptoms, is under quarantine, or has been exposed to COVID
-19.   Post signage on entrance door that no one with a fever or symptoms of COVID
-19 will be 
permitted in the restaurant. 
  Screen al
l employees each shift before entering the facility for symptoms (i.e., fever of 
100°F or higher, cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle 

aches, fatigue, diarrhea, or vomiting). Immediately exclude anyone with symptoms from 

entering. 
  Where possible, workstations should be staggered to avoid employees standing directly 

opposite one another or next to each other, and maintain six feet of social distance.
  Require employees with direct customer contact to w
ear cloth or other mask 
that is 
laundered or replaced daily. 
  Frequently monitor employee handwashing and ensure no bare hand contact with ready
-to-eat foods. 
  Notify customers by signage to report concerns of social distancing infractions to the 
restaurant manager. 
  Use technolo
gical solutions where possible to reduce person
-to-person interaction (e.g. 
mobile ordering, mobile access to menus to plan in advance, text on arrival for seating, 
contactless payment options). 
  Enhance employee safety training, emphasizing employee healt
h, handwashing, and 
personal hygiene practices. 
  Have hand sanitizer and sanitizing products readily available for employees and 

customers. 
  Designate with signage, tape, or by other means appropriate social distancing spacing for 

employees and customers. 
Facilitate and designate social distancing for those waiting to 

enter your establishment. 
  If possible, provide distinct walking lanes to minimize close contact as customers are 

being seated to conform to social distancing practices. For example, in a tabl
e/booth 
layout, central tables can be removed, and markings can be installed designating the path 

for seating. 
  Assign an employee each shift to monitor social distancing, sanitation, and hygiene 

protocols.

      16  Gym and Workout Facilities
  Customer Protection
  Screen customers fo
r illness upon entry to the gym and ask q
uestion customers regarding 
COVID
-19 symptoms
 o Have you been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID
-19? o Are you experiencing a cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat?
 o Have you had a fever in the last 48 hours?
  Keep doors and windows open where possible to improve ventilation
  Post signs 
encouraging social distancing (visible to customers)
  Require that customers wash or sanitize their hands upon entering and leaving the facility
  Require customers to clean equipment they come in contact with using disinfecting wipes 
before and after each us
e  Encourage customers to use only one piece of equipment at a time (i.e., no circuits or 

ﬁsuper settingﬂ) so that machines are cleaned after use
  Consider limiting workout length to avoid unnecessary exposure, decrease congestion, 

and allow for additional s
anitization
  Recommend that persons more vulnerable or at
-risk for  COVID
-19 as identified by the 
CDC
Šincluding those who are over the age of 65 or those who have chronic medical 
conditions
Štake extra precaution or refrain 
from use of the facility.
  
Busines
s Process Adaptations
  Restrict facility access to staffed hours only (i.e., any unmanned facilities must be 

manned) and limit facility occupancy to 50 percent of capacity as dictated by fire code 

(as such capacity is adjusted in consideration of closed are
as of the facility pursuant to 
these guidelines).
  Mitigate exposure in the workplace by implementing social distancing guidelines and 

modify scheduling.
  Staff to conduct regular (i.e., every 2 hours) disinfecting of high
-touch surfaces, 
equipment and commo
n areas of the facility using disinfectant cleaning supplies 
according to CDC guidelines.
  Close showers, locker rooms, and lockers until further notice. Ask customers to instead 
use small gym bags to store personal belongings; remind customers to appropria
tely 
monitor or secure such personal belongs or provide a secure area monitored by staff.
  Close all swimming pools, hot tubs, saunas and other recreational water or spa facilities.
  Close all basketball courts, racquetball courts, and other places where for
mal and 
informal group or team sports may occur.
  Any youth or adult team leagues or sports should remain closed.
 17   Only allow group fitness classes if classes can be completed in accordance with social 
distancing recommendations (including but not limited to
: less than 50% capacity and 
with more than 6 feet of distance maintained between participants at all times; no shared 
equipment during the class; sufficiently adjusted class schedules to allow for deep 
cleaning between classes; martial arts and other cont
act activities should be completed 
without any person
-to-person contact).
  Encourage all employees and customers to wear PPE where applicable, and recommend 

that customers wear a face covering (not N
-95 or medical masks, which should be 
reserved for healthc
are workers).
  Adjust equipment layout and close or restrict access to equipment to maintain at least six 
feet of distance between equipment.
  Temporarily close water fountains, common areas, break rooms, check
-in counters, 
where customers or employees may c
ongregate. Encourage users to provide their own 
water.
  No self
-service options (coffee bars, smoothie stations and other forms of communal food 
in facilities). Food retail should follow restaurant guidelines.
  Ensure that staffing of facilities is sufficien
t to enable enhanced sanitization and cleaning 
measures.
         
      18  Legal Considerations of ﬁBack to Workﬂ
  Generally Speaking:
 Employers may face liability under O
ccupational 
Safety and 
Health 
Administration (OSHA)
 regulations for actions taken before, during and after the COVID
-19 crisis.
 Although there is no 
ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ standard, several OSHA standards could be applied to preventing the spread of the 
disease.  This includes, but is not limited to, the ﬁGeneral Duty
 Clauseﬂ which requires 
employers to provide their workers ﬁ
employment and a place of employment, which are free 
from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ
 29 USC 654(a)(1)
 Though it would be difficult 
for an employee to clearly demonstrate that they contracted the 
illness while at their place of employment, contact tracing could lay a clear path back to the 

workplace.  
 As we begin to repatriate our offices and bring the workforce back, there are many a
dditional 
considerations that may impact decisions.  There is always a chance that employers may face 

claims of discrimination while making difficult choices in how they phase in the returning work 
force.  
It is impera
tive that such decisions are made for 
reasons
 not based on a protected cl
ass as 
defined by
 discrimination laws. 
Specifically, employers need to
 careful
ly document their 
selection process and avoid making any 
decisions based on
 age or disabilities that might be 
perceived to 
make an employee or 
applicant more vulnerable to the virus.
 For businesses that are forced to make a reduction in work force, these same types of 

considerations should be applied.  Employees that used sick leave to care for family members or 

because of concerns about their ow
n well
-being that are later part of a force reduction may 
consider this a retaliation or retribution by the employer.  
 Personal Protective Equipment:
 Many employers are considering placement of policies or protocols that include the wearing of 

facemasks, 
gloves or other protective equipment to help stop the spread of any illness in their 
workplace.  
While the intent is well placed, certain considerations should be made:
  Have you accounted for those with access and functional needs?  This may include things
 like protective wear for those who use wheelchairs, options for those with allergies to 
latex, etc.  
  Have you provided proper training for use of the protective wear? Improper donning and 
doffing of protective equipment is often the cause of infection am
ong medical 
professionals.  
  Can you provide fit testing for masks?  
 Legally, if the employer can accommodate these types of exceptions or alternatives without 
causing undue hardship to the business, they are required to do so.  
 19   Screening and other 
access controls
 Even those things that are intende
d to protect the work force may cause legal issues if not 
completed correctly.  Currently, under the medical emergency, leniencies have been provided 
to companies in the interest of protecting the general p
ublic from COVID
-19. As the disaster continues and a new normal emerges, there may be a review of these 
procedures which may cause problems if not implemented correctly.
 Some basic steps may help to protect companies:
 1. Decide who
 you will screen.  While some companies are screening ALL employees, 
others are screening only those who have been in contact with someone who has been 
tested positive for COVID 19.  Many companies are testing everyone who enters the 
facility while others 
do not have that option (retail stores and others with rotating 
customer base where it would be impractical).  One of the most important considerations 
is consistency and assurance that the testing is completed on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 2. Training for th
ose who are doing the screening.  Again, there are differences in how 
companies are doing the screening.  Some companies are allowing employees to take 
their own temperature while others are providing a trained employee to take all 

temperatures.  Still oth
ers are hiring third party contractors for this purpose.  Whichever 
method you choose, maintain records to ensure discrimination has not taken place. 
 3. Safety Concerns and Requirements.  Ensure that those taking temperatures are provided 
proper personal pro
tective equipment.
 4. Equipment.  Consider what type of thermometers will be used and be consistent.  Speed, 
accuracy and ease of use are main considerations for most of the businesses 
implementing checks.  
 5. Decide where checks will take place.  The main cons
ideration is privacy.  The best 
location would allow some discretion for the person being screened.  Ideally, there would 
be an alternate location that anyone failing the screening could be taken to walk them 
though the next steps.
 6. Develop a screening proc
ess or policy and stick to it. 
 7. Develop a documentation process.
 8. Communicate the processes to your employees prior to implementation.
 9. Send employees home if they have a fever or if they refuse to be tested.  Communicate 
this to employees prior to beginning
 the testing process.  If an employee is sent home, 
provide them with instructions or expectations (call their primary care provider, get tested 

if possible, etc.)
.  Follow up periodically with employees that are sent home.
 10. Establish return to work procedu
re and communicate that with employees.  Written 

policy should be sent with anyone that is sent home.  Some considerations may include:
 a. Cannot return to work unless at least 10 days has passed since onset of symptoms
 b. Cannot return to work until at least 72
 hours after employee has experienced no 
fever
 20  c. Has been completely symptom free for at least 72 hours. 
 Legal implications related to the return to the office are endless.  The protection of employer and 
employee are mutually beneficial and both need to be
 considered for a successful restart of our 
companies and our economy.  
It™s important to actively engage your legal department or other 
counsel early in your processes.

Back t
o Work Considerations
  The considerations for repatriation of your workforce to the office following COVID 19 has been 
on the minds of most business owners across Iowa, the United States and the world.  In order to 

do so safely, we have to consider what changes must take place t
o protect the physical and 
mental wellbeing of our employees, contractors, vendors and visitors to each of our facilities.  
 We still face many challenges as we look forward to the next few weeks.  Lack of Personal 

Protective Equipment (PPE) for employees,
 shortage of testing for individuals, conflicting 

information on how we handle employees that have tested positive or have been given the 

diagnosis of a presumptive positive are all things that add a complex dynamic to bringing our 

workforce back.  
 We hav
e pulled together ma
ny different resources to provide a
 variety of businesses and 
organizations gui
dance as they address reopening.

   2  General Tips
  General Health Guidelines:
  Encourage staff and employees to take their temperature twice a day. Set a baseline 
temperature that, if exceeded, will deny entry to your facility.  Currently, the CDC has
 set 
the temperature of 100.4 as a guidepost for medical workers
.  Work with staff to encourage handwashing and using hand sanitizer every hour.
  Promote etiqu
ette for coughing, sneezing and handwashing. 
  Encourage staff to wear face masks
 for homemade cloth face mask to prevent the spread 
of COVID
-19.  General 
Reopening Guidance
:  Use 
CDC guidance related to 
cleaning and d
isinf
ection for community f
acilities
, including frequent cleaning and disinfecting of all high touch surfaces.
  Encourage
 and provide supplies to allow for frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing 
for employees and the public.
  Provide reminders to employees and members of the public to stay at least 6 feet away 

from others when in the facility and mark 
six
-foot
 intervals wh
en possible.
  Post signage at the door indicating no one should enter the establishment if they currently 

have
 symptoms
 or have been around anyone with a confirmed COVID
-19 diagnosis in 
the last 14 days.
  If an employee or a member of the public becomes ill 
while at the facility, ask them to 
share that information with management, leave the facility and then call their health care 
provider.
  Members of the public and employees should consider the use of 
cloth face coverings 
(when practical) if staying at least
 6 feet aw
ay from others is not possible.
   Anyone who is
 high risk
 for more severe COVID
-19 illnes
s should continue to stay 
home.
  Businesses should continue to follow 
IDPH™s business guidance related to preventing, 
detecting an
d reporting outbreaks.
  Busine
sses should use
 messaging 
to remind employees of steps they should be taking to 
protect their own health while at work.
      3  General Guidance for All Employees
   Employees should take and log temperature before shifts
 o Best practice: employers to take 
temperatures onsite with a no
-touch thermometer 
each day upon arrival at work.
 o Minimum: temperatures can be taken before arriving. Normal temperature should 
not exceed 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Employees should also be screened for COVID
-19 symptoms includ
ing: 
fever of 100°F 
or higher, cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle aches
, fatigue, diarrhea or vomiting
. Immediately exclude anyone with symptoms from entering.
  Staff should wear face coverings (not N
-95 or medical masks, 
which should be reserved 
for healthcare workers) and other personal protection items as recommended by the CDC.
  Provide training on personal protective equipment based on CDC guidelines.
  Staff will need to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer every hour.
  Practice recommended social distancing to the greatest extent possible
ŠﬁFurther is 

safer.ﬂ
  Stagger shifts, breaks and meals, in compliance with wage and hour laws and regulations, 

to maintain social distancing. Consider reduced staffing requirements where
 possible.
  Prohibit congregating in break rooms or common areas and limit capacity of such areas to 

allow for safe social distancing minimum of 6 feet whenever possible.
 o Employees should increase hygiene practices
Šwash hands more frequently, 
avoid touching
 face, practice good respiratory etiquette when coughing or 
sneezing.
  All employees should stay home if feeling ill, report any symptoms of illness to 

supervisor and require notification of COVID
-19 positive case in employee™s household. 
Employees who are 
particularly vulnerable to COVID
-19 according to the CDC (e.g., due 
to age or underlying conditions) are encouraged to stay home.
  Update the Employee Illness Policy to include the symptoms of ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ or create a 
COVID
-19 specific policy. All staff shoul
d sign the policy, and the policy should be 
posted for confirmation.
  Post extensive signage on health policies, including the following documents, in the 
workplace to help educate building occupants on COVID
-19 best practices.
       4   Workplace Leave 
Policies
   Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and 
that employees are aware of and understand these policies.
  Maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family 
member 
or take care of children due to school and childcare closures. Additional 
flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave and allowing employees 
to donate sick leave to each other.
  Employers that do not currently offer sick leave to some o
r all of their employees may 
want to draft non
-punitive ﬁemergency sick leaveﬂ policies.
  Employers should not require a positive COVID
-19 test result or a healthcare provider™s 
note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick lea
ve, or to 
return to work. Healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy 
and not able to provide such documentation in a timely manner.
  Review human resources policies to make sure that policies and practices are consistent 
with p
ublic health recommendations and are consistent with existing state and federal 
workplace laws (for more information on employer responsibilities, visit th
e Department 
of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website.  
  Connect employees to emp
loyee assistance program (EAP) resources (if available) and 
community resources as needed. Employees may need additional social, behavioral, and 
other services, for example, to cope with the death of a loved one.
        
    5   Cleaning and Disinfecting Your
 Facility
  Always w
ear gloves when cleaning and disinfecting
 Clean
  Clean surfaces using soap and water, then use disinfectant.
  Cleaning with soap and water
 reduces number of germs, dirt and impurities
 on the 
surface.
 Disinfecting kills germs
 on surfaces.
  Practice routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces.
 o More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use.
 o Surfaces and objects in public places, such as shopping carts and point of sale 
keypads should be clea
ned and disinfected before each use.
 Disinfect
  Recommend use of
 EPA
-registered household cleaners.
  Follow the instructions on the label
 to ensure safe and effective use of the product.
 Many products recommend:
 o Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see
 product label)
 o Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation 
during use of the product.
 o Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used
 if appropriate for the 
surface.
 o Check the label to see if your bleach is intended
 for disinfection, and ensure the 
product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for 
safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection.
 o Unexpired household bleach will be effective against co
ronaviruses when 
properly diluted.
 Follow manufacturer™s instructions
 for application and proper ventilation. Never 
mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.
 Leave solution
 on the surface for
 at least 1 minute.
  To make a bleach solution
, mix:
 o 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water
 OR o 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water
  Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.
  Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.
 6   Soft surfaces
 For soft sur
faces such as
 carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes
  Clean the surface using soap and water
 or with cleaners appropriate for use on these 
surfaces.
  Launder items
 (if possible) according to the manufacturer™s 
instructions. Use
 the 
warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely.
 OR  Disinfect with an EPA
-registered household disinfectant.
 These disinfectants
 meet 
EPA™s criteria for use against COVID
-19. Electronics
 For electronics, such as
 tablets, touch screens, 
keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines
  Consider putting a
 wipeable cover
 on electronics.
  Follow manufacturer™s instruction
 for cleaning and disinfecting.
 o If no guidance,
 use alcohol
-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol
. Dry surface 
thoroughly.
 Laundry
 For clothing, towels, linens and other items
:  Launder items according to the manufacturer™s instructions.
 Use the warmest 
appropriate water setting
 and dry items completely.
  Wear disposable gloves
 when handling dirty laundry from a 
person who is sick.
  Dirty laundry from a person who is sick
 can be washed with other people™s items
.  Do not shake
 dirty laundry.
  Clean and
 disinfect clothes hampers
 according to guidance above for surfaces.
  Remove gloves, and
 wash hands right away
.     7   Cleaning and disinfecting your building or facility if someone is sick
  Close off areas
 used by the person who is sick.
 o Companies do not necessarily need to close operations, if they can close off affected 
areas.
  Open outside doors and windows and use 
ventilating fans
 to increase air circulation in the 
area.
  Wait 24 hours
 before you clean or disinfect. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as 
possible.
  Clean and disinfect
 all areas used by the person who is sick
, such as offices, bathrooms, 
common a
reas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote 
controls, and ATM machines.
  Once area has been
 appropriately disinfected
, it
 can be opened for use
. o Workers without close contact
 with the person who is sick can return to wor
k immediately after disinfection.
  If more than 7 days
 since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional 
cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.
 o Continue routine cleaning and disinfection. This includes everyday practices that 
busine
sses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment.
 Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas
  Outdoor areas, like
 playgrounds in schools and parks
 generally require
 normal routine 
cleaning
, but do not require disinfection.
 o Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds
- it is not an efficient use of 
supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID
-19 to the public.
 o High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings 
should be cleaned routinely.
 o Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or 
groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended.
  Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected.
 o Spread of COVID
-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not 
effec
tive.
  8   When cleaning
  Regular cleaning staff
 can clean and disinfect community spaces.
 o Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals.
  Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including 
handling trash
. o Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the 
cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.
 o Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the 
wearer
 and the surrounding area.
  Wash your hands often
 with soap and water for 20 seconds.
 o Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person 
who is sick.
 o Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly di
rty, 
an alcohol
-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. 
However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.
  Additional key times to wash hands
 include:
 o After blowing one™s nose, coughing, or sneezing.
 o After using the restroom.
 o Before eating or preparing food.
 o After contact with animals or pets.
 o Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance 
(e.g., a child).
 Additional Considerations for Employers
  Educate workers
 performing
 cleaning, laundry, and trash pick
-up to recognize the 
symptoms of COVID
-19.  Ensure workers are
 trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals
 used in the 
workplace in accordance with OSHA™s Hazard Communication standard.
  Comply
 with OSHA™s standards on 
Bloodborne Pathogens), including proper disposal of 
regulated waste, and PPE.
 Alternative Disinfection Methods
  The efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity 
UV radiation, and LED blue light against COVID
-19 viru
s is not known.
 9  o EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as 
UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm 
whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against 
the spread of COVID
-19.  CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they 
are effective in reducing the spread of COVID
-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels 
could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.
  CDC only recommends use of the
 EPA approved cleaners
 against the virus that causes 
COVID
-19.     
       
       
  10   Industry Specific Reopening Guidelines
  Dining and Bars
 It is critical that restaurant personnel review, and restaurants 
must
 ensure the following 
mandatory requirements
 included in the governor™s proclamation are in place and enforced: 
   Limit indoor and outdoor seating capacity to 50 percent of normal operating capacity. 
  Limit group size to no more than six people. 
  Arrange se
ating to provide a minimum of six feet between tables. 
  Disallow customer self
-service of food or beverages, including buffets and salad bars. 
  Implement reasonable measures to ensure social distancing of employees and customers, 
increased hygiene practice
s, and other public health measures to reduce the risk of 

transmission of COVID
-19.   
Additionally, the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals and the Iowa Department of 

Public Health 
strongly recommend that all restaurants adhere to the following guid
ance
:    To the extent possible, eliminate seating at bars within restaurants. 
  Eliminate entertainment operations or activities. 
  Serve alcohol to a guest only if the guest is also ord
ering and consuming food items.
  Disinfect tables and chairs after each customer use. 
  Clean and sanitize table condiments, reusable menus, digital ordering devices, check 

presenters, pens, napkin dispensers, salt and pepper shakers, and other commonly
-touched items between each customer 
use. 
  Use prewrapped silverware and eliminate table presets including table tents, menus, salt 

and pepper shakers, napkin dispensers, and condiments. 
  Eliminate refilling customer beverages from common containers (i.e., pitchers). 
   Discard single
-use or p
aper articles, such as paper menus, after each use. 
  Create and implement an enhanced cleaning/sanitizing schedule for all food contact 

surfaces, and cleaning/disinfecting of non
-food contact surfaces. 
  Disinfect commonly
-touched surfaces throughout entire
 facility (both front and back
-of-house) such as door handles, credit card machines, bathrooms, etc., at least once every 

hour. 
  11    To the extent possible, on
-premises dining should be by reservation only and customers 
should be screened upon reservation an
d arrival as to whether anyone in the party is 
positive, has any symptoms, is under quarantine, or has been exposed to COVID
-19.   Post signage on entrance door that no one with a fever or symptoms of COVID
-19 will be 
permitted in the restaurant. 
  Screen al
l employees each shift before entering the facility for symptoms (i.e., fever of 
100°F or higher, cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle 

aches, fatigue, diarrhea, or vomiting). Immediately exclude anyone with symptoms from 

entering. 
  Where possible, workstations should be staggered to avoid employees standing directly 

opposite one another or next to each other, and maintain six feet of social distance.
  Require employees with direct customer contact to w
ear cloth or other mask 
that is 
laundered or replaced daily. 
  Frequently monitor employee handwashing and ensure no bare hand contact with ready
-to-eat foods. 
  Notify customers by signage to report concerns of social distancing infractions to the 
restaurant manager. 
  Use technolo
gical solutions where possible to reduce person
-to-person interaction (e.g. 
mobile ordering, mobile access to menus to plan in advance, text on arrival for seating, 
contactless payment options). 
  Enhance employee safety training, emphasizing employee healt
h, handwashing, and 
personal hygiene practices. 
  Have hand sanitizer and sanitizing products readily available for employees and 

customers. 
  Designate with signage, tape, or by other means appropriate social distancing spacing for 

employees and customers. 
Facilitate and designate social distancing for those waiting to 

enter your establishment. 
  If possible, provide distinct walking lanes to minimize close contact as customers are 

being seated to conform to social distancing practices. For example, in a tabl
e/booth 
layout, central tables can be removed, and markings can be installed designating the path 

for seating. 
  Assign an employee each shift to monitor social distancing, sanitation, and hygiene 

protocols.

      16  Gym and Workout Facilities
  Customer Protection
  Screen customers fo
r illness upon entry to the gym and ask q
uestion customers regarding 
COVID
-19 symptoms
 o Have you been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID
-19? o Are you experiencing a cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat?
 o Have you had a fever in the last 48 hours?
  Keep doors and windows open where possible to improve ventilation
  Post signs 
encouraging social distancing (visible to customers)
  Require that customers wash or sanitize their hands upon entering and leaving the facility
  Require customers to clean equipment they come in contact with using disinfecting wipes 
before and after each us
e  Encourage customers to use only one piece of equipment at a time (i.e., no circuits or 

ﬁsuper settingﬂ) so that machines are cleaned after use
  Consider limiting workout length to avoid unnecessary exposure, decrease congestion, 

and allow for additional s
anitization
  Recommend that persons more vulnerable or at
-risk for  COVID
-19 as identified by the 
CDC
Šincluding those who are over the age of 65 or those who have chronic medical 
conditions
Štake extra precaution or refrain 
from use of the facility.
  
Busines
s Process Adaptations
  Restrict facility access to staffed hours only (i.e., any unmanned facilities must be 

manned) and limit facility occupancy to 50 percent of capacity as dictated by fire code 

(as such capacity is adjusted in consideration of closed are
as of the facility pursuant to 
these guidelines).
  Mitigate exposure in the workplace by implementing social distancing guidelines and 

modify scheduling.
  Staff to conduct regular (i.e., every 2 hours) disinfecting of high
-touch surfaces, 
equipment and commo
n areas of the facility using disinfectant cleaning supplies 
according to CDC guidelines.
  Close showers, locker rooms, and lockers until further notice. Ask customers to instead 
use small gym bags to store personal belongings; remind customers to appropria
tely 
monitor or secure such personal belongs or provide a secure area monitored by staff.
  Close all swimming pools, hot tubs, saunas and other recreational water or spa facilities.
  Close all basketball courts, racquetball courts, and other places where for
mal and 
informal group or team sports may occur.
  Any youth or adult team leagues or sports should remain closed.
 17   Only allow group fitness classes if classes can be completed in accordance with social 
distancing recommendations (including but not limited to
: less than 50% capacity and 
with more than 6 feet of distance maintained between participants at all times; no shared 
equipment during the class; sufficiently adjusted class schedules to allow for deep 
cleaning between classes; martial arts and other cont
act activities should be completed 
without any person
-to-person contact).
  Encourage all employees and customers to wear PPE where applicable, and recommend 

that customers wear a face covering (not N
-95 or medical masks, which should be 
reserved for healthc
are workers).
  Adjust equipment layout and close or restrict access to equipment to maintain at least six 
feet of distance between equipment.
  Temporarily close water fountains, common areas, break rooms, check
-in counters, 
where customers or employees may c
ongregate. Encourage users to provide their own 
water.
  No self
-service options (coffee bars, smoothie stations and other forms of communal food 
in facilities). Food retail should follow restaurant guidelines.
  Ensure that staffing of facilities is sufficien
t to enable enhanced sanitization and cleaning 
measures.
         
      18  Legal Considerations of ﬁBack to Workﬂ
  Generally Speaking:
 Employers may face liability under O
ccupational 
Safety and 
Health 
Administration (OSHA)
 regulations for actions taken before, during and after the COVID
-19 crisis.
 Although there is no 
ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ standard, several OSHA standards could be applied to preventing the spread of the 
disease.  This includes, but is not limited to, the ﬁGeneral Duty
 Clauseﬂ which requires 
employers to provide their workers ﬁ
employment and a place of employment, which are free 
from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ
 29 USC 654(a)(1)
 Though it would be difficult 
for an employee to clearly demonstrate that they contracted the 
illness while at their place of employment, contact tracing could lay a clear path back to the 

workplace.  
 As we begin to repatriate our offices and bring the workforce back, there are many a
dditional 
considerations that may impact decisions.  There is always a chance that employers may face 

claims of discrimination while making difficult choices in how they phase in the returning work 
force.  
It is impera
tive that such decisions are made for 
reasons
 not based on a protected cl
ass as 
defined by
 discrimination laws. 
Specifically, employers need to
 careful
ly document their 
selection process and avoid making any 
decisions based on
 age or disabilities that might be 
perceived to 
make an employee or 
applicant more vulnerable to the virus.
 For businesses that are forced to make a reduction in work force, these same types of 

considerations should be applied.  Employees that used sick leave to care for family members or 

because of concerns about their ow
n well
-being that are later part of a force reduction may 
consider this a retaliation or retribution by the employer.  
 Personal Protective Equipment:
 Many employers are considering placement of policies or protocols that include the wearing of 

facemasks, 
gloves or other protective equipment to help stop the spread of any illness in their 
workplace.  
While the intent is well placed, certain considerations should be made:
  Have you accounted for those with access and functional needs?  This may include things
 like protective wear for those who use wheelchairs, options for those with allergies to 
latex, etc.  
  Have you provided proper training for use of the protective wear? Improper donning and 
doffing of protective equipment is often the cause of infection am
ong medical 
professionals.  
  Can you provide fit testing for masks?  
 Legally, if the employer can accommodate these types of exceptions or alternatives without 
causing undue hardship to the business, they are required to do so.  
 19   Screening and other 
access controls
 Even those things that are intende
d to protect the work force may cause legal issues if not 
completed correctly.  Currently, under the medical emergency, leniencies have been provided 
to companies in the interest of protecting the general p
ublic from COVID
-19. As the disaster continues and a new normal emerges, there may be a review of these 
procedures which may cause problems if not implemented correctly.
 Some basic steps may help to protect companies:
 1. Decide who
 you will screen.  While some companies are screening ALL employees, 
others are screening only those who have been in contact with someone who has been 
tested positive for COVID 19.  Many companies are testing everyone who enters the 
facility while others 
do not have that option (retail stores and others with rotating 
customer base where it would be impractical).  One of the most important considerations 
is consistency and assurance that the testing is completed on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 2. Training for th
ose who are doing the screening.  Again, there are differences in how 
companies are doing the screening.  Some companies are allowing employees to take 
their own temperature while others are providing a trained employee to take all 

temperatures.  Still oth
ers are hiring third party contractors for this purpose.  Whichever 
method you choose, maintain records to ensure discrimination has not taken place. 
 3. Safety Concerns and Requirements.  Ensure that those taking temperatures are provided 
proper personal pro
tective equipment.
 4. Equipment.  Consider what type of thermometers will be used and be consistent.  Speed, 
accuracy and ease of use are main considerations for most of the businesses 
implementing checks.  
 5. Decide where checks will take place.  The main cons
ideration is privacy.  The best 
location would allow some discretion for the person being screened.  Ideally, there would 
be an alternate location that anyone failing the screening could be taken to walk them 
though the next steps.
 6. Develop a screening proc
ess or policy and stick to it. 
 7. Develop a documentation process.
 8. Communicate the processes to your employees prior to implementation.
 9. Send employees home if they have a fever or if they refuse to be tested.  Communicate 
this to employees prior to beginning
 the testing process.  If an employee is sent home, 
provide them with instructions or expectations (call their primary care provider, get tested 

if possible, etc.)
.  Follow up periodically with employees that are sent home.
 10. Establish return to work procedu
re and communicate that with employees.  Written 

policy should be sent with anyone that is sent home.  Some considerations may include:
 a. Cannot return to work unless at least 10 days has passed since onset of symptoms
 b. Cannot return to work until at least 72
 hours after employee has experienced no 
fever
 20  c. Has been completely symptom free for at least 72 hours. 
 Legal implications related to the return to the office are endless.  The protection of employer and 
employee are mutually beneficial and both need to be
 considered for a successful restart of our 
companies and our economy.  
It™s important to actively engage your legal department or other 
counsel early in your processes.

symptoms of COVID
-19.  Family members of the contact can continue their normal 
routines. 
 Howe
ver, the contact must stay home and not leave.
  No visitors should be at the home.
  
If a player or coach has a member of their household diagnosed with COVID
-19, the entire 
household will be placed in self
-isolation. 
 Isolation ends at 14 days from the las
t contact of the ill 
family member. 
 For some individuals this is 14 days, for
 others it may be several weeks.
  If you have a player/coach diagnosed with COVID
-19, it is 
 possible most of the team and coaches 
will be placed in
 isolation.
 According to CDC, 
COVID
-19 symptoms may appear 2
-14 days after exposure to the virus. 
 Anyone 

that appears ill, or
 states that they have been ill, should follow the guidelines for individuals ill with 
COVID

  Sore throat
  New loss of taste or smell
  COVID
-19 is a new virus and we are still learning about it. 
 This guidance may be updated 
as new 
information becomes
 available. School
 sponsored activities
 should
 consider the following:
  Social distancing should be practiced by all people involved. This is a distance of 6 feet or 
greater between
 individuals. 
 Œ this is a requirement from the Go
vernor.
  Face coverings should be encouraged.
  Hand sanitizer or handwashing should be provided and encouraged.
  Develop 
a plan as to how many people will be allowed to enter and exit that ensures 

social

 1   Iowa Guidance for Senior Centers and Adult Day Programs
 June 
11, 2020
  This guidance is for senior centers and adult day programs as they consider ways to safely resume 
activities. 
These facilities often serve vulnerable populations that are older or who 
have underlying 
conditions. T
he following recommendations serve to help prevent illness in these settings.
 Such programs 
should consider virus activity in the communities they ser
ve to help inform activities.
 Information about virus 
activity in the community can be found at 
coronavirus.iowa.gov
 by clicking on the county where the facility 
is located, and analyzing the v
irus activity information that appears below the blue state map.
  Any Iowan considering joining senior center or adult day program activities should make their own 
decisions about whether they can safely participate.
  Screening
 - All employees
, visitors
, patrons and clients
 should be screened for symptoms
, fever
 and close 
contacts with anyone who has been recently diagnosed with COVID
-19 at arrival. 
 - Persons reporting symptoms or having a fever should not be allowed to enter and should seek 
healthcare as a
ppropriate.
 - Any
one
 who has been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID
-19 in the last 14 days 
should not be allowed to enter and should quarantine for 14 days from their last contact
 with the 
confirmed case
. - Consider 
requiring 
the use of cloth fac
e coverings 
for all employees
, visitors
, patrons and clients
 when safe and appropriate.
  Activities
 - When possible, activities should be performed while maintaining a 6 foot distance with small 
numbers of individuals. Consider 
requiring 
the use of cloth face coverings especially when 
maintaining 
distance
 of at least 6 feet between individuals
 is not possible.
 - Avoid sharing objects and practice frequent cleaning of objects that are handled with an 
appropriate, EPA
-approved cleaner.
 - Employe
es, visitors
, patrons and clients
 should practice frequent hand
-washing or sanitizing 
(containing at least 60% alcohol) 
and supplies should be readily available throughout a center.
  Communal Dining
 - The number of individuals dining together at one time sho
uld be adjusted to ensure limited 
numbers of people dining at the same table, and spacing of at least 6 feet between tables.
 - If staff assistance with eating is required, appropriate hand hygiene must occur between residents 
as well as 
appropriate use of PPE
.   Environmental Cleaning
 - Clean high
-touch surfaces and restrooms with an appropriate, EPA
-approved cleaner at regular 
intervals throughout the day.
                                         
 2    Early Identification
 - If an employee
, visitor
, patron or client
 becomes ill while in a senior center or adult daycare, they 
should immediately isolate
, leave the facility as soon as possible
 and seek care and testing as 
appropriate. 
Testing can be accessed through 
Test Iowa
, the State Hygienic Laboratory (
see 
criteria
), or at the discretion of an individual™s healthcare provider.
 Upon recognition
 or notification
 of a case of
 COVID
-19 in 
an employee, visitor, patron or client
 a center
 should
 work with local or 
state public health 
as soon as possible 
to perform an assessment of close contacts
 (persons who 
have spent more than 15 minutes within 6 feet) 
at the center
. This will allow for 
notifications and 
recommendations 
to those close contacts 
as 
advised 
by public health.
 - Centers should 
immediately 
perform appropriate 
cleaning, including 
disinfection of 
high
-touch 
surfaces.
 - Centers may make individual decisions to close if needed.

 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease 
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has spread from China to 
many other countries around the world, including the United 
States. Depending on the severity of COVID-19™s international 
impacts, outbreak conditionsŠincluding those rising to the level 
of a pandemicŠcan affect all aspects of daily life, including 
travel, trade, tourism, food supplies, and ˜nancial markets.
To reduce the impact of COVID-19 outbreak conditions on 
businesses, workers, customers, and the public, it is important 
for all employers to plan now for COVID-19. For employers who 
have already planned for in˚uenza pandemics, planning for 
COVID-19 may involve updating plans to address the speci˜c 
exposure risks, sources of exposure, routes of transmission, 
and other unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., compared 
to pandemic in˚uenza viruses). Employers who have not 
prepared for pandemic events should prepare themselves 
and their workers as far in advance as possible of potentially 
worsening outbreak conditions. Lack of continuity planning can 
result in a cascade of failures as employers attempt to address 
challenges of COVID-19 with insuf˜cient resources and workers 
who might not be adequately trained for jobs they may have to 
perform under pandemic conditions.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
developed this COVID-19 planning guidance based on traditional 
infection prevention and industrial hygiene practices. It focuses on 
the need for employers to implement engineering, administrative, 
and work practice controls and personal protective equipment 
(PPE), as well as considerations for doing so.
This guidance is intended for planning purposes. Employers 
and workers should use this planning guidance to help 
identify risk levels in workplace settings and to determine 
any appropriate control measures to implement. Additional 
guidance may be needed as COVID-19 outbreak conditions 
change, including as new information about the virus, its 
transmission, and impacts, becomes available.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION4The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services™ Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides the 
latest information about COVID-19 and the global outbreak: 
www.
 cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov
.The OSHA COVID-19 webpage offers information speci˜cally 
for workers and employers: 
www.osha.gov/covid-19
.This guidance is advisory in nature and informational in 
content. It is not a standard or a regulation, and it neither 
creates new legal obligations nor alters existing obligations 
created by OSHA standards or the 
Occupational Safety and 
Health Act
 (OSH Act). Pursuant to the OSH Act, employers 
must comply with safety and health standards and regulations 
issued and enforced either by OSHA or by an OSHA-approved 
State Plan. In addition, the OSH Act™s General Duty Clause, 
Section 5(a)(1)
, requires employers to provide their employees 
with a workplace free from recognized hazards likely to cause 
death or serious physical harm. OSHA-approved State Plans 
may have standards, regulations and enforcement policies that 
are different from, but at least as effective as, OSHA™s. Check 
with your 
State Plan
, as applicable, for more information. 
About COVID-19
Symptoms of COVID-19
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can 
cause illness ranging from mild to severe and, in some cases, 
can be fatal. Symptoms typically include fever, cough, and 
shortness of breath. Some people infected with the virus have 
reported experiencing other non-respiratory symptoms. Other 
people, referred to as 
asymptomatic cases
, have experienced 
no symptoms at all.
According to the CDC, symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in 
as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-195How COVID-19 Spreads
Although the ˜rst human cases of COVID-19 likely resulted 
from exposure to infected animals, infected people can spread 
SARS-CoV-2 to other people.
The virus is thought to 
spread mainly from person-
to-person, including:
 Between people who 
are
 in close contact 
with
 one another (within 
about 6 feet).
 Through respiratory 
droplets produced when an infected person coughs or 
sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of 
people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching 
a surface or object that has SARS-CoV-2 on it and then 
touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this 
is not thought to be the primary way the virus spreads.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are most 
symptomatic (i.e., experiencing fever, cough, and/or shortness 
of breath). Some spread might be possible before people 
show symptoms; there have been reports of this type of 
asymptomatic transmission with this new coronavirus, but this 
is also not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Although the United States has implemented public health 
measures to limit the spread of the virus, it is likely that some 
person-to-person transmission will continue to occur. 
The CDC website provides the latest information about 
COVID-19 transmission: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
about/transmission.html
.Medium exposure risk
 jobs
 include those that 
require frequent and/or 
close contact with (i.e., 
within 6 feet of) other people 
who may

 infected
 with 
SARS
-CoV-2.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION6How a COVID-19 Outbreak Could 
Affect
 Workplaces
Similar to in˚uenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes 
COVID-19, has the potential to cause extensive outbreaks. 

Under conditions associated with widespread person-to-

person spread, multiple areas of the United States and other 

countries may see impacts at the same time. In the absence 

of a vaccine, an outbreak may also be an extended event. As a 

result, workplaces may experience: 
 Absenteeism
. Workers could be absent because they are 
sick; are caregivers for sick family members; are caregivers 

for children if schools or day care centers are closed; have 

at-risk people at home, such as immunocompromised 

family members; or are afraid to come to work because of 

fear of possible exposure. 
 Change in patterns of commerce
. Consumer demand for 
items related to infection prevention (e.g., respirators) is 

likely to increase signi˜cantly, while consumer interest in 
other goods may decline. Consumers may also change 
shopping patterns because of a COVID-19 outbreak. 

Consumers may try to shop at off-peak hours to reduce 

contact with other people, show increased interest in home 

delivery services, or prefer other options, such as drive-

through service, to reduce person-to-person contact. 
 Interrupted supply/delivery
. Shipments of items from 
geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be 

delayed or cancelled with or without noti˜cation.

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reveals

GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-197Steps All Employers Can Take to 
Reduce
 Workers™ Risk of Exposure 
to
 SARS-CoV-2
This section describes basic steps that every employer can 
take to reduce the risk of worker exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the 
virus that causes COVID-19, in their workplace. Later sections 
of this guidanceŠincluding those focusing on jobs classi˜ed 
as having low, medium, high, and very high exposure risksŠ
provide speci˜c recommendations for employers and workers 
within speci˜c risk categories.
Develop an Infectious Disease Preparedness 
and Response Plan
If one does not already exist, develop an infectious disease 
preparedness and response plan that can help guide protective 
actions against COVID-19.
Stay abreast of guidance from federal, state, local, tribal, and/or 
territorial health agencies, and consider how to incorporate those 
recommendations and resources into workplace-speci˜c plans.
Plans should consider and address the level(s) of risk 
associated with various worksites and job tasks workers 
perform at those sites. Such considerations may include:
 Where, how, and to what sources of SARS-CoV-2 might 
workers be exposed, including:
 The general public, customers, and coworkers; and
 Sick individuals or those at particularly high risk 
of infection (e.g., international travelers who have 
visited locations with widespread sustained (ongoing) 
COVID-19 transmission, healthcare workers who have 
had unprotected exposures to people known to have, or 
suspected of having, COVID-19).
 Non-occupational risk factors at home and in community 
settings.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION8 Workers™ individual risk factors (e.g., older age; 
presence of chronic medical conditions, including 
immunocompromising conditions; pregnancy).
 Controls necessary to address those risks.
Follow federal and state, local, tribal, and/or territorial (SLTT) 
recommendations regarding development of contingency 
plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks, 
such as:
 Increased rates of worker absenteeism.
 The need for social distancing, staggered work shifts, 
downsizing operations, delivering services remotely, and 
other exposure-reducing measures.
 Options for conducting essential operations with a reduced 
workforce, including cross-training workers across different 
jobs in order to continue operations or deliver surge services.
 Interrupted supply chains or delayed deliveries.
Plans should also consider and address the other steps that 
employers can take to reduce the risk of worker exposure to 
SARS-CoV-2 in their workplace, described in the sections below.
Prepare to Implement Basic Infection 
Prevention Measures
For most employers, protecting workers will depend on 
emphasizing basic infection prevention measures. As 
appropriate, all employers should implement good hygiene 
and infection control practices, including: 
 Promote frequent and thorough 
hand washing
, including 
by providing workers, customers, and worksite visitors with 
a place to wash their hands. If soap and running water are 
not immediately available, provide alcohol-based hand rubs 
containing at least 60% alcohol.
 Encourage workers to 
stay home if they are sick
.  Encourage 
respiratory etiquette
, including covering coughs 
and sneezes.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-199 Provide customers and the public with tissues and trash 
receptacles.
 Employers should explore whether they can establish 
policies and practices
, such as ˚exible worksites (e.g., 
telecommuting) and ˚exible work hours (e.g., staggered 
shifts), to increase the physical distance among 
employees and between employees and others if state 
and local health authorities recommend the use of social 
distancing strategies. 
 Discourage workers from using other workers™ phones, desks, 
of˜ces, or other work tools and equipment, when possible.
 Maintain regular housekeeping practices, including routine 
cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, equipment, and 
other elements of the work environment. When choosing 
cleaning chemicals, employers should consult information 
on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved 
disinfectant labels with claims against emerging viral 
pathogens. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral 
pathogens claims are expected
 to be effective against 
SARS-CoV-2 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow 
the manufacturer™s instructions for use of all cleaning and 
disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application 
method and contact time, PPE). 
Develop Policies and Procedures for Prompt 
Identi˜cation and Isolation of Sick People, 
if
 Appropriate
 Prompt identi˜cation and isolation of potentially infectious 
individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, 
customers, visitors, and others at a worksite.
 Employers should inform and encourage employees to 
self-monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 if they 
suspect possible exposure. 
 Employers should develop policies and procedures for 
employees to report when they are sick or experiencing 
symptoms of COVID-19. 
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION10 Where appropriate, employers should develop policies 
and procedures for immediately isolating people who have 
signs and/or symptoms
 of COVID-19, and train workers to 
implement them. Move potentially infectious people to a 
location away from workers, customers, and other visitors. 
Although most worksites do not have speci˜c isolation 
rooms, designated areas with closable doors may serve as 
isolation rooms until potentially sick people can be removed 
from the worksite. 
 Take steps to limit spread of the respiratory secretions of 
a person who may have COVID-19. Provide a face mask, 
if feasible and available, and ask the person to wear it, if 
tolerated. Note: A face mask (also called a surgical mask, 
procedure mask, or other similar terms) on a patient or 
other sick person should not be confused with PPE for 
a worker; the mask acts to contain potentially infectious 
respiratory secretions at the source (i.e., the person™s nose 
and mouth).
 If possible, isolate people suspected of having COVID-19 
separately from those with con˜rmed cases of the virus 
to prevent further transmissionŠparticularly in worksites 
where medical screening, triage, or healthcare activities 
occur, using either permanent (e.g., wall/different room) or 
temporary barrier (e.g., plastic sheeting).
 Restrict the number of personnel entering isolation areas.
 Protect workers in close contact with (i.e., within 6 feet of) 
a sick person or who have prolonged/repeated contact 
with such persons by using additional engineering and 
administrative controls, safe work practices, and PPE. 
Workers whose activities involve close or prolonged/
repeated contact with sick people are addressed further in 
later sections covering workplaces classi˜ed at medium and 
very high or high exposure risk.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1911Develop, Implement, and Communicate about 
Workplace Flexibilities and Protections
 Actively encourage sick employees to stay home.
 Ensure that sick leave policies are ˚exible and consistent 
with public health guidance and that employees are aware 
of these policies. 
 Talk with companies that provide your business with 
contract or temporary employees about the importance 
of sick employees staying home and encourage them to 
develop non-punitive leave policies.
 Do not require a healthcare provider™s note for employees 
who are sick with acute respiratory illness to validate their 
illness or to return to work, as healthcare provider of˜ces 
and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able 
to provide such documentation in a timely way.
 Maintain ˚exible policies that permit employees to stay home 
to care for a sick family member. Employers should be aware 
that more employees may need to stay at home to care for 
sick children or other sick family members than is usual.
 Recognize that workers with ill family members may need 
to stay home to care for them. See CDC™s Interim Guidance 
for Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in Homes and 
Residential Communities: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html
. Be aware of workers™ concerns about pay, leave, safety, 
health, and other issues that may arise during infectious 
disease outbreaks. Provide adequate, usable, and 
appropriate training, education, and informational material 
about business-essential job functions and worker health 
and safety, including proper hygiene practices and the 
use of any workplace controls (including PPE). Informed 
workers who feel safe at work are less likely to be 
unnecessarily absent.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION12 Work with insurance companies (e.g., those providing 
employee health bene˜ts) and state and local health 
agencies to provide information to workers and customers 
about medical care in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.
Implement Workplace Controls
Occupational safety and health professionals use a framework 
called the ﬁhierarchy of controlsﬂ to select ways of controlling 
workplace hazards. In other words, the best way to control 
a hazard is to systematically remove it from the workplace, 
rather than relying on workers to reduce their exposure. 
During a COVID-19 outbreak, when it may not be possible to 
eliminate the hazard, the most effective protection measures 
are (listed from most effective to least effective): engineering 
controls, administrative controls, safe work practices (a type 
of administrative control), and PPE. There are advantages 
and disadvantages to each type of control measure when 
considering the ease of implementation, effectiveness, and 
cost. In most cases, a combination of control measures will be 
necessary to protect workers from exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the types of workplace controls discussed below, 
CDC guidance for businesses provides employers and workers 
with recommended SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies 
to implement in workplaces: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/speci˜c-groups/guidance-business-response.html
.Engineering Controls
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-
related hazards. In workplaces where they are appropriate, these 
types of controls reduce exposure to hazards without relying on 
worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to 
implement. Engineering controls for SARS-CoV-2 include:
 Installing high-ef˜ciency air ˜lters.
 Increasing ventilation rates in the work environment.
 Installing physical barriers, such as clear plastic 
sneeze
 guards.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1913 Installing a drive-through window for customer service.
 Specialized negative pressure ventilation in some settings, 
such as for aerosol generating procedures (e.g., airborne 
infection isolation rooms in healthcare settings and 
specialized autopsy suites in mortuary settings).
Administrative Controls
Administrative controls require action by the worker or employer. 
Typically, administrative controls are changes in work policy 
or procedures to reduce or minimize exposure to a hazard. 
Examples of administrative controls for SARS-CoV-2 include:
 Encouraging sick workers to stay at home.
 Minimizing contact among workers, clients, and 
customers by replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual 
communications and implementing telework if feasible. 
 Establishing alternating days or extra shifts that reduce 
the total number of employees in a facility at a given time, 
allowing them to maintain distance from one another while 
maintaining a full onsite work week.
 Discontinuing nonessential travel to locations with ongoing 
COVID-19 outbreaks. Regularly check CDC travel warning 
levels at: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers
. Developing emergency communications plans, including a 
forum for answering workers™ concerns and internet-based 
communications, if feasible.
 Providing workers with up-to-date education and training 
on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors (e.g., 
cough etiquette and care of PPE). 
 Training workers who need to use protecting clothing 
and equipment how to put it on, use/wear it, and take 
it off correctly, including in the context of their current 
and potential duties. Training material should be easy to 
understand and available in the appropriate language and 
literacy level for all workers.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION14Safe Work Practices
Safe work practices are types of administrative controls that 
include procedures for safe and proper work used to reduce 
the duration, frequency, or intensity of exposure to a hazard. 
Examples of safe work practices for SARS-CoV-2 include:
 Providing resources and a work environment that promotes 
personal hygiene. For example, provide tissues, no-touch 
trash cans, hand soap, alcohol-based hand rubs containing 
at least 60 percent alcohol, disinfectants, and disposable 
towels for workers to clean their work surfaces. 
 Requiring regular hand washing or using of alcohol-based 
hand rubs. Workers should always wash hands when they 
are visibly soiled and after removing any PPE.
 Post handwashing signs in restrooms. 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
While engineering and administrative controls are considered 
more effective in minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2, PPE 
may also be needed to prevent certain exposures. While 
correctly using PPE can help prevent some exposures, it 
should not take the place of other prevention strategies. 
Examples of PPE include: gloves, goggles, face shields, face 
masks, and respiratory protection, when appropriate. During 
an outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, 
recommendations for PPE speci˜c to occupations or job tasks 
may change depending on geographic location, updated 
risk assessments for workers, and information on PPE 
effectiveness in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Employers 
should check the 
OSHA
 and 
CDC
 websites regularly for 
updates about recommended PPE.
All types of PPE must be:
 Selected based upon the hazard to the worker.
 Properly ˜tted and periodically re˜tted, as applicable 
(e.g.,
 respirators).
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1915 Consistently and properly worn when required.
 Regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, 
as
 necessary.
 Properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of, 
as
 applicable, to avoid contamination of self, others, or 
the environment.
Employers are obligated to provide their workers with PPE 
needed to keep them safe while performing their jobs. The 
types of PPE required during a COVID-19 outbreak will be 
based on the risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 while 
working and job tasks that may lead to exposure.
Workers, including those who work within 6 feet of patients 
known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2 
and those performing aerosol-generating procedures, need to 
use respirators: 
 National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH)-approved, N95 ˜ltering facepiece 
respirators or better must be used in the context of a 
comprehensive, written respiratory protection program 
that includes ˜t-testing, training, and medical exams. 
See OSHA™s Respiratory Protection standard, 29 CFR 
1910.134 at 
www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/
standardnumber/1910/1910.134
. When disposable N95 ˜ltering facepiece respirators are 
not available, consider using other respirators that provide 
greater protection and improve worker comfort. Other 
types of acceptable respirators include: a R/P95, N/R/P99, 
or N/R/P100 ˜ltering facepiece respirator; an air-purifying 
elastomeric (e.g., half-face or full-face) respirator with 
appropriate ˜lters or cartridges; powered air purifying 
respirator (PAPR) with high-ef˜ciency particulate arrestance 
(HEPA) ˜lter; or supplied air respirator (SAR). See CDC/
NIOSH guidance for optimizing respirator supplies at: 
www.
 cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy
. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION16 Consider using PAPRs or SARs, which are more protective 
than ˜ltering facepiece respirators, for any work operations 
or procedures likely to generate aerosols (e.g., cough 
induction procedures, some dental procedures, invasive 
specimen collection, blowing out pipettes, shaking or 
vortexing tubes, ˜lling a syringe, centrifugation). 
 Use a surgical N95 respirator when both respiratory 
protection and resistance to blood and body ˚uids is needed. 
 Face shields may also be worn on top of a respirator to 
prevent bulk contamination of the respirator. Certain 
respirator designs with forward protrusions (duckbill 
style) may be dif˜cult to properly wear under a face shield. 
Ensure that the face shield does not prevent air˚ow through 
the respirator.
 Consider factors such as function, ˜t, ability to 
decontaminate, disposal, and cost. OSHA™s Respiratory 
Protection eTool provides basic information on respirators 
such as medical requirements, maintenance and care, 
˜t testing, written respiratory protection programs, and 
voluntary use of respirators, which employers may also 
˜nd bene˜cial in training workers at: 
www.osha.gov/SLTC/
etools/respiratory
. Also see NIOSH respirator guidance at: 
www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators
. Respirator training should address selection, use (including 
donning and dof˜ng), proper disposal or disinfection, 
inspection for damage, maintenance, and the limitations 
of respiratory protection equipment. Learn more at: 
www.
osha.gov/SLTC/respiratoryprotection
. The appropriate form of respirator will depend on the 
type of exposure and on the transmission pattern of 
COVID-19. See the NIOSH ﬁRespirator Selection Logicﬂ

.GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1917Follow Existing OSHA Standards
Existing OSHA standards may apply to protecting workers 
from exposure to and infection with SARS-CoV-2.
While there is no speci˜c OSHA standard covering SARS-
CoV-2 exposure, some OSHA requirements may apply to 
preventing occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Among the 
most relevant are:
 OSHA™s Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) standards 
(in general industry,
 29 CFR 1910 Subpart I), which require 
using gloves, eye and face protection, and respiratory 
protection. See: 
www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/
standardnumber/1910#1910_Subpart_I
.  When respirators are necessary to protect workers or 
where employers require respirator use, employers 
must implement a comprehensive respiratory protection 
program in accordance with the Respiratory Protection 
standard (29 CFR 1910.134). See: 
www.osha.gov/laws-
regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134
.  The General Duty Clause,
 Section 5(a)(1)
 of 
the
 Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970, 
29 USC 654(a)(1), which requires employers to furnish to 
each worker ﬁemployment and a place of employment, 
which are free from recognized hazards that are causing 
or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ 
See:
 www.
 osha.
 gov/laws-regs/oshact/completeoshact
. OSHA™s Bloodborne Pathogens standard (
29 CFR 1910.1030
) applies to occupational exposure to human blood and other 
potentially infectious materials that typically do not include 
respiratory secretions that may transmit SARS-CoV-2. 
However, the provisions of the standard offer a framework 
that may help control some sources of the virus, including 
exposures to
 body ˚uids
 (e.g., respiratory secretions) not 
covered by the standard. See: 
www.osha.gov/laws-regs/
regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030
. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION18The OSHA COVID-19 webpage provides additional information 
about OSHA standards and requirements, including 
requirements in states that operate their own OSHA-approved 
State Plans, recordkeeping requirements and injury/illness 
recording criteria, and applications of standards related to 
sanitation and communication of risks related to hazardous 
chemicals that may be in common sanitizers and sterilizers. 
See: 
www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html
.Classifying Worker Exposure to 
SARS
-CoV-2
Worker risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the 
virus that causes COVID-19, during an outbreak may vary from 
very high to high, medium, or lower (caution) risk. The level 
of risk depends in part on the industry type, need for contact 
within 6 feet of people known to be, or suspected of being, 
infected with SARS-CoV-2, or requirement for repeated or 
extended contact with persons known to be, or suspected of 
being, infected with SARS-CoV-2. To help employers determine 
appropriate precautions, OSHA has divided job tasks into 
four risk exposure levels: very high, high, medium, and lower 
risk. The Occupational Risk Pyramid shows the four exposure 
risk levels in the shape of a pyramid to represent probable 
distribution of risk. Most American workers will likely fall in the 
lower exposure risk (caution) or medium exposure risk levels.
Occupational Risk Pyramid 
 for COVID-19
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1919Very High Exposure Risk
Very high exposure risk
 jobs are those with high potential for 
exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID-19 during 
speci˜c medical, postmortem, or laboratory procedures. 
Workers in this category include:
 Healthcare workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, dentists, 
paramedics, emergency medical technicians) performing 
aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation, cough 
induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental 
procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection) on 
known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
 Healthcare or laboratory personnel collecting or handling 
specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients 
(e.g., manipulating cultures from known or suspected 
COVID-19 patients).
 Morgue workers performing autopsies, which generally 
involve aerosol-generating procedures, on the bodies of 
people who are known to have, or suspected of having, 
COVID-19 at the time of their death.
High Exposure Risk
High exposure risk
 jobs are those with high potential for 
exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID-19. Workers 
in this category include:
 Healthcare delivery and support staff (e.g., doctors, 
nurses, and other hospital staff who must enter patients™ 
rooms) exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients. 
(Note: when such workers perform aerosol-generating 
procedures, their exposure risk level becomes 
very high.
) Medical transport workers (e.g., ambulance vehicle 
operators) moving known or suspected COVID-19 patients 
in enclosed vehicles.
 Mortuary workers involved in preparing (e.g., for burial or 
cremation) the bodies of people who are known to have, or 
suspected of having, COVID-19 at the time of their death.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION20Medium Exposure Risk
Medium exposure risk
 jobs include those that require frequent 
and/or close contact with (i.e., within 6 feet of) people who 
may be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but who are not known 
or suspected COVID-19 patients. In areas without ongoing 
community transmission, workers in this risk group may 
have frequent contact with travelers who may return from 
international locations with widespread COVID-19 transmission. 
In areas where there 
is ongoing community transmission, 
workers in this category may have contact be with the 
general public (e.g., in schools, high-population-density work 
environments, and some high-volume retail settings).
Lower Exposure Risk (Caution)
Lower exposure risk (caution)
 jobs are those that do not 
require
 contact with people known to be, or suspected of 
being, infected with SARS-CoV-2 nor frequent close contact 
with (i.e., within 6
 feet of) the general public. Workers in this 
category have minimal occupational contact with the public 
and other coworkers.
Jobs Classi˜ed at Lower Exposure 
Risk (Caution): What to Do to 
Protect
 Workers
For workers who do not have frequent contact with the general 
public, employers should follow the guidance for ﬁ
Steps All 
Employers Can Take to Reduce
 Workers™ Risk of Exposure 
to
 SARS-CoV-2
,ﬂ on page 7 of this booklet and implement 
control measures described in this section.
Engineering Controls
Additional engineering controls are not recommended for 
workers in the lower exposure risk group. Employers should 
ensure that engineering controls, if any, used to protect workers 
from other job hazards continue to function as intended. 
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1921Administrative Controls
 Monitor public health communications about COVID-19 
recommendations and ensure that workers have access 
to that information. Frequently check the CDC COVID-19 
website: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov
. Collaborate with workers to designate effective means of 
communicating important COVID-19 information.
Personal Protective Equipment
Additional PPE is not recommended for workers in the lower 
exposure risk group. Workers should continue to use the PPE, 
if
 any, that they would ordinarily use for other job tasks.
Jobs Classi˜ed at Medium Exposure 
Risk: What to Do to Protect Workers
In workplaces where workers have medium exposure risk, 
employers should follow the guidance for ﬁ
Steps All Employers 
Can Take to Reduce
 Workers™ Risk of Exposure to
 SARS-CoV-2
,ﬂ 
on page 7 of this booklet and implement control measures 
described in this section.
 Engineering Controls
 Install physical barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards, 
where feasible.
Administrative Controls
 Consider offering face masks to ill employees and customers 
to contain respiratory secretions until they are able leave 
the workplace (i.e., for medical evaluation/care or to return 
home). In the event of a shortage of masks, a reusable face 
shield that can be decontaminated may be an acceptable 
method of protecting against droplet transmission. See CDC/
NIOSH guidance for optimizing respirator supplies, which 
discusses the use of surgical masks, at: 
www.cdc.gov/
coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy
.OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION22 Keep customers informed about symptoms of COVID-19 and 
ask sick customers to minimize contact with workers until 
healthy again, such as by posting signs about COVID-19 in 
stores where sick customers may visit (e.g., pharmacies) or 
including COVID-19 information in automated messages sent 
when prescriptions are ready for pick up.
 Where appropriate, limit customers™ and the public™s access to 
the worksite, or restrict access to only certain workplace areas.
 Consider strategies to minimize face-to-face contact (e.g., drive-
through windows, phone-based communication, telework). 
 Communicate the availability of medical screening or other 
worker health resources (e.g., on-site nurse; telemedicine 
services).
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
When selecting PPE, consider factors such as function, ˜t, 
decontamination ability, disposal, and cost. Sometimes, when 
PPE will have to be used repeatedly for a long period of time, a 
more expensive and durable type of PPE may be less expensive 
overall than disposable PPE. 
Each employer should select 
the combination of PPE that 
protects workers speci˜c to 
their workplace.
Workers with medium 
exposure risk may need to 
wear some combination 
of gloves, a gown, a face 
mask, and/or a face shield 
or goggles. PPE ensembles 
for workers in the medium 
exposure risk category will 
vary by work task, the results 
of the employer™s hazard 
assessment, and the types of 
exposures workers have on 
the job.
High exposure risk jobs 
are those with high 
potential for exposure 
to known or suspected 
sources of COVID-19.
Very high exposure risk
 jobs are those with high 
potential for exposure 
to known or suspected 
sources of COVID-19 
during speci˜c medical, 
postmortem, or laboratory 
procedures that involve 
aerosol generation or 
specimen collection/
handling.

more recommendations on air handling systems at: 
www.
cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5210a1.htm
. CDC recommends that patients with known or suspected 
COVID-19 (i.e., person under investigation) should be placed 
in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), if available.
 Use isolation rooms when available for performing 
aerosol-generating procedures on patients with known 
or suspected COVID-19. For postmortem activities, use 
autopsy suites or other similar isolation facilities when 
performing aerosol-generating procedures on the bodies 
of people who are known to have, or suspected of 
having, COVID-19 at the time of their death. See the CDC 
postmortem guidance at: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-

. OSHA 
also provides guidance for postmortem activities on its 
COVID-19 webpage:

. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION24 Use special precautions associated with Biosafety Level
 3 
when handling specimens from known or suspected 
COVID-19 patients. For more information about biosafety 
levels, consult the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) ﬁBiosafety in Microbiological and 
Biomedical Laboratoriesﬂ at 
www.cdc.gov/biosafety/
publications/bmbl5
.Administrative Controls
If working in a healthcare facility, follow existing guidelines 
and facility standards of practice for identifying and isolating 
infected individuals and for protecting workers. 
 Develop and implement policies that reduce exposure, such 
as cohorting (i.e., grouping) COVID-19 patients when single 
rooms are not available. 
 Post signs requesting patients and family members to 
immediately report symptoms of respiratory illness on 
arrival at the healthcare facility and use disposable face 
masks.
 Consider offering enhanced medical monitoring of workers 
during COVID-19 outbreaks.
 Provide all workers with job-speci˜c education and training 
on preventing transmission of COVID-19, including initial 
and routine/refresher training.
 Ensure that psychological and behavioral support is 
available to address employee stress.
Safe Work Practices
 Provide emergency responders and other essential 
personnel who may be exposed while working away from 
˜xed facilities with alcohol-based hand rubs containing at 
least 60% alcohol for decontamination in the ˜eld. 
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1925Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Most workers at high or very high exposure risk likely need 
to wear gloves, a gown, a face shield or goggles, and either 
a face mask or a respirator, depending on their job tasks and 
exposure risks. 
Those who work closely with (either in contact with or within 
6 feet of) patients known to be, or suspected of being, infected 
with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, should wear 
respirators. In these instances, see the PPE section beginning 
on 
page 
14 of this booklet, which provides more details 
about respirators. For the most up-to-date information, also 
visit OSHA™s COVID-19 webpage: 
www.osha.gov/covid-19
. PPE ensembles may vary, especially for workers in laboratories 
or morgue/mortuary facilities who may need additional 
protection against blood, body ˚uids, chemicals, and other 
materials to which they may be exposed. Additional PPE may 
include medical/surgical gowns, ˚uid-resistant coveralls, 
aprons, or other disposable or reusable protective clothing. 
Gowns should be large enough to cover the areas requiring 
protection. OSHA may also provide updated guidance for PPE 
use on its website: 
www.osha.gov/covid-19
.NOTE: 
Workers who dispose of PPE and other infectious waste 
must also be trained and provided with appropriate PPE.
The CDC webpage ﬁHealthcare-associated Infectionsﬂ 
(www.

infection control in healthcare facilities.
Workers Living Abroad or Travelling

Employers should communicate to workers that the DOS cannot 
provide Americans traveling or living abroad with medications 
or supplies, even in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.
As COVID-19 outbreak conditions change, travel into or out of 
a country may not be possible, safe, or medically advisable. 
It is also likely that governments will respond to a COVID-19 
outbreak by imposing public health measures that restrict 
domestic and international movement, further limiting the U.S. 
government™s ability to assist Americans in these countries. It 
is important that employers and workers plan appropriately, 
as it is possible that these measures will be implemented 
very quickly in the event of worsening outbreak conditions in 
certain areas. 
More information on COVID-19 planning for workers living and 
traveling abroad can be found at: 
www.cdc.gov/travel
. For More Information
Federal, state, and local government agencies are the best 
source of information in the event of an infectious disease 
outbreak, such as COVID-19. Staying informed about the latest 
developments and recommendations is critical, since speci˜c 
guidance may change based upon evolving outbreak situations.

DHS also encourages childcare settings to limit rooms to 10 individuals per room when possible, and to increase space between children. Recess, activities and hallway passing should be staggered to limit interactions. To remain open during this time, we insist all childcare centers follow practices outlined below.

ALLMUST
1. Implement common-sense practices for preventing disease spread, such as:covering a cough, staying home when sick, and washing hands. Childcare
providers are an important part of ensuring children maintain personal hygiene
best practices. Increase these practices, particularly after eating or using the
restroom. Talk to children about these practices. The CDC recommends washing
hands for at least 20 seconds.2. 


3. Implement regular deep-cleaning practices at a minimum once a week, while
continuing daily cleaning as normal.(Continued)

COVID
-19 Testing Framework
 for 
Iowa
 Updated 
05/06
/2020
   Healthcare providers can
 test patients, as they deem appropriate for COVID
-19 infection at national 
reference laboratories. If healthcare providers choose to test a patient through a national reference 
laboratory, there is no need to call IDPH for approval. The specimens should be
 sent directly to the 
reference laboratory in accordance with the laboratory™s guidance.
 Reference laboratories will charge 
patients for this 
testing;
 public health has no funding to cover the costs of these tests.  
  The State Hygienic Laboratory will continue to perform COVID
-19 testing in accordance with 
one of 
the 
following criteria
 (these criteria may broaden as the pandemic expands
 and additional testing resources 
become available
).    Hospitalized patient (of any
 age) with fever or respiratory illness for diagnosis or any 
hospitalized patient prior to discharge to a long term care facility or other nursing 
care facility.
   Older adult (> 60 years of age) with fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, 
difficulty 
breathing) and chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, 
immunosuppressive medications, chronic lung disease, or chronic kidney disease)
   Person of any age with fever or respiratory illness who lives in a congregate setting 
(i.e., long ter
m care facilities, dormitories, residential facilities, correctional facilities, 
treatment facilities)
   Healthcare worker, essential services personnel, first responder or crit
ical 
infrastructure 
worker with fever or respiratory illness (e.g., healthcare w
orker, fire, 
EMS, law enforcement, residential facility staff, food supply and water plant 
operators)
   If patients meet th
e testing criteria
, please
 submit the specimen to the State Hygienic Laboratory in 
accordance with the following guidance
, http://shl.uiowa.edu/dcd/covid19.xml
. There is no longer a requirement to contact IDPH for testing approval
 prior to submission to the State 
Hygienic Laboratory
.  To conserve limited public health resource
s, please ensure that ONLY specimens 
from patients meeting the testing criteria above are submitted to the State Hygienic Laboratory.  The cost 
of this testing is assigned to the public health system.
 Please ensure you are using appropriate infection contr
ol guidance when collecting specimens, which 
includes at a minimum contact and droplet precautions with eye protection.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.
 

 
Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person who is sick.
 

 
Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available and
 
hands are not visibly dirty, use a 
hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash 
hands with soap and water.
 

 
Additional key times to clean hands include:
 
o
 

 
o
 
After using the restroom

Shared space:
 
If you have to share space, make sure the room has good air flow.
 

 
Open the window and turn on a fan (if possible) to increase air circulation.
 

 
Improving ventilation helps 
remove respiratory droplets from the air.
 
 
Eat in separate rooms or areas
 

 
Stay separated:
 
The person who is sick should eat (or be fed) in their room, if possible.
 

 
Wash dishes and utensils using gloves and hot water:
 
Handle any dishes, cups/glasses, or 
silverware used by the person who is sick with gloves. Wash them with soap and hot
 
water or in a

ick
 
 
When to wear a cloth face cover or gloves
 
Sick person:
 

 
The person who is sick should wear a
 
cloth face covering
 
when they are around other 
people at 

 

 
The cloth face covering helps prevent a person who is sick from spreading the virus to others. It 
keeps respiratory droplets contained and from reaching other people.
 

 
Cloth face coveri
ngs should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble 
breathing, or is not able to remove the covering without help.
 
Caregiver:
 

 
Wear gloves when you touch or have contact with blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, mucus, 
vomit, and urine. Throw out gloves into a lined trash can.
 

 
A caregiver may wear a
 
cloth face covering
 
when caring for a person who is sick, however
 
the 
protective effects (how well the cloth face covering protects healthy people from breathing in the 
virus) are unknown.
 
o

   ‚FACE COVID
™ How to respond effectivel
y to the Corona crisis
  by Dr Russ Harris, author of The Happiness Trap
  ‚FACE COVID
™ is a 
set of
 practical steps for responding effectively to the Corona crisis, using 
the principles of acceptance and commitment therapy
 (ACT)
. Here™s a quick summary of the 
key steps, and in the pages that follow we™ll explore them
 all in more depth
: F = Focus on what
™s in your control
 A = Acknowledge your thoughts 
& feelings
 C = Co
me back into
 your body
 E = Engage in 
what you™re doing
  C = Committed action
 O = Open
ing
 up 
 V = Values
 I = 
Identify resources
 D = Disinfect & 
distance
   Let™s now explore these, one by 
one
  F = Focus on what™s in your control
 The Corona crisis can affect us in many different ways: physically, emotionally, 
economic
ally, socially, 
and psychologically.
 All of us
 are (or  soon will be) dealing with 
the 
very real 
challenge
s of 
widespread 
serious illness
 and
 the
 inabilities of healthcare 
systems
 to 
cope with it
, social and community
 disruption
, economic fallout and 
financial problems
 , obstacles and interruptions
 to many aspects of life
 – and the list goes on. 
 And w
hen 
we are facing a cris
is of any sort, fear and anxiety are inevitable; they are normal, 
natural responses
 to challenging situations infused with danger and uncertaint
y. 
It™s all too 
easy to get lost in worrying and ruminating about all sorts of things that are out of your 

contr
ol: what might happen in the future; how the virus might affect you or your loved ones 
or your community or your country or the world
 Œ and what will happen then 
- and so on. 
And while it™s 
completely 
natural 
for us 
to get lost in such worries, it™s not us
eful or helpful. 
Indeed the more 
we focus on what™s 
not
 in our control, the more h
opeless 
or 
anxious 
we™re 
likely to feel. 
 
So the 
single most useful thing anyone can do in any type of crisis 
Œ Corona
-related or 
otherwise 
-  is to: 
focus on what™s in your control.
 You can™t control what happens in the future.
 You can™t control Corona virus itself or the 
world economy or 
how
 your gover
nment manage
s this whole sordid mess. 
And y
ou can™t 
magically control your feelings
, 
eliminat
ing
 all that perfectly natural fear and anxiety. 
But 
you can control 
what you do
 - here and now
. An
d that matters.
 Because
 what you do
 - here and now 
- can
 make a
 huge
 difference to yourself, and anyone 
living
 with you, and 
a significant difference to 
the community around you.

   The reality is, 
we 
all 
have far more control over our 
behaviour,
 than we do over our 
thoughts and feelings.
 So our number one aim is to take control of our 
behaviour
 - right
 here and now
 - to 
respond
 effective
ly to this crisis. 
 This involves both dealing with our inner world 
Œ all our difficult thoughts and feelings 
- and 
our outer world 
Œ all the real problems w
e are facing. 
How do we do this? Well, w
hen a big 
storm blows up, the boats in the harbour drop anchor 
Œ because if they don™t, they™ll get 
swept out to sea. 
And of course, 
dropping anchor doesn™t make 
the
 storm go away (anchors 
can™t control the weather) 
- but it 
can hold a
 boat steady in the harbour, until the storm 
passes in its own good time.
 Similarly, in
 an ongoing crisis, we™re all going to experience
 ‚emotional storm
s™: unhelpful
 thoughts spinning inside our head
, and
 painful feelings whirling around our body. And 
if we™re swept away by th
at storm
 inside us
, there™s nothing effective we can do
. So the first 
practical step is to ‚drop anchor™, using the simple ACE formula:
  A = Acknowledge your thoughts and feelings
 C = Come back into your body
 E = Engage in what you™re doing
  Let™s explore these one by one:
  A = Acknowledge your thoughts and feelings
 Silently and kindly acknowledge whatever is ‚showing up™ inside you: thoughts, feelings, 
emotions, memories,
 sensation,
 urges. Take the stance of a curious scientist, observing 
what™s going on in your inner world.
 And while continuing to acknowledge your thoughts and feelings, also ....
  C = Come back into your body
 Come back into and connect with your physical body. Find your own way of doing this. You 

could try some or all of
 the following, or find your own methods:
 Ł Slowly pushing your feet hard into the floor.
 Ł Slowly straightening up your back and spine; if sit
ting, sitting upright and forward in your 
chair.
 Ł Slowly pressing your fingertips together
 Ł Slowly stretching your arms or neck, shrugging your shoulders.
 Ł Slowly breathing

   Note: you are not trying to turn away from, escape, avoid or distract yourself f
rom what is 
happening in your inner
 world. The aim is to remain aware of your thoughts and feelings, 
continue to acknowledge their presence .... and at
 the same time, come back into and 
connect with your body
, and 
actively mov
e it.
 Why? So you can gain as 
much control as 
possible over your physical actions
, even though you can™t control your feelings. 
(Remember, F = Focus on what™s in your control)
 And 
as you
 acknowledg
e your thoughts 
& feelings, and co
me back into
 your body, also ....
  E = Engage in what y
ou™re doing
 Get a sense of where you are and refocus your attention on the activity you are doing.
 Find your own way of doing this.
 You could try some or all of
 the following suggestions, or 
find your own methods:
 Ł Look around the room and notice 5 things you can see.
 Ł Notice 3 or 4 things you can hear.
 Ł Notice what you can smell or taste or sense in your nose and mouth
 Ł Notice what you are doing
 Ł End the ex
ercise by giving your full attention to the task or activity at hand.
 (And if you 
don™t have any meaningful activity to do, see the next 3 steps.)
 Ideally, run through the ACE cycle slowly 3 or 4 times, to turn it into a 2
- 3 minute exercise.
 If you wish, 
to help you get the hang of this, 
you can download some free audio recordings 
of ‚dropping anchor™ exercises, varying from 1 minute to
 11 minutes in length. You can listen 
to these and use them as a guide to help you develop this skill. You ca
n download or stream 
them from the left hand box on this 
webpage: 
https://www.actmindfully.com.au/free
-stuff/free
-audio/
 NOTE: please don™t skip the A of ACE; it™s so important to keep 
acknowledging the thoughts 
and feelings present,
 especially if they are difficult or uncomfortable. If you skip the A, this 
exercise will turn into a distraction technique 
Œ which it™s not supposed to be.
 Dropping anchor is a very useful skill. You can use it for handling difficult thoughts, feelings, 

emotions, memories, urges and sensations more effectively; switching off auto
-pilot and 
engaging in life; grounding and steadying yourself in difficult situat
ions; disrupting 

rumination, obsessing and worrying; and focusing your attention on the task or activity you 

are doing. The better you anchor yourself in the here and now, the more control you have 
over your actions 
Œ which makes it a lot easier to do the 
next steps: 
COVID

   C = 
Committed Action
  Committed action means e
ffective action, guided by your core values; action you take 
because it™s truly important to you; action you take even if it brings up difficult thoughts and 

feelings.
 Once you have 
dropped anchor, using the ACE formula, you will have a lot of 
control over your actions
 Œ so this makes it easier to 
do the things that
 truly
 matter. 
 Now o
bviously th
at includes all th
ose 
protective measures against Corona 
Œ frequent 
handwashing, social d
istancing, and so on.
 But i
n addition to those fundamentals of 
effective action,
 consider:
 What are simple ways to look after yourself
, those 
you live with
, and those you can 
realistically help
? What kind, caring, supportive deeds you can do? 
 Can you say 
some kind words to someone in distress 
Œ in person
 or via a phone call or text 
message?
  Can you help someone out with a task or a chore, or cook a meal, or hold someone™s hand, 

or play a game with a young child? 
 Can you comfort and soothe someone who is 
sick? Or in the most serious of cases, nurse 
them and access whatever medical assistance is available? 
 And if you™re spending a lot more time at home, through self
-isolation or forced quarantine, 
or social distancing, what are the most effective ways to s
pend that time? 
 You may want to consider physical exercise to stay fit, cooking (as) healthy food (as possible, 
given restrictions), 
and 
doing meaningful activities by yourself or with others. 
 And if you™re familiar with acceptance and commitment therapy
 or other mindfulness
-based 
approaches, 
how 
can you actively practice some of those mindfulness skills? 
 Repeatedly throughout the day, ask yourself ‚What can I 
do right now 
- no matter how small 
it may be 
- that improves life for myself or others I live wit
h, or people in my community
?™ And whatever the answer is
 Œ do it, and
 engage in it fully.
  O = Opening up
 Opening up means making room for
 difficult feelings an
d being kind to yourself.
 Difficult 
feelings are guaranteed to keep on showing up as this crisis unfolds: fear, anxiety, anger, 
sadness, guilt, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and 
many 
more.
  We can™t stop them from arising; they™re normal reactions. B
ut we can open up and make 
room for them: 
acknowledge they are
 normal,
 allow them to be there
 (even though they 
hurt)
, and treat ourselves kindly.
  Remember, s
elf
-kindness is essential if you want to cope well with this crisis 
Œ especially if 
you are in a caregiver role. If you™ve ever flown on a plane, you™ve heard this message: ‚In 

event of an emergency, put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others.™ 
Well, s
elf
-kindness is your own oxygen mask; if you need to look after others, you™ll do it a whole lot 

better if you™re also taking 
good 
care of yourself.
   So ask yourself, ‚If someone I loved was going through this experience, feeling what I am 

feeling 
Œ if I wanted to be kind and caring towards them, how would I treat them? How 
would I behave towards them? What might I say or do?™ Then try treating yourself the same 

way.

-kindness, also known as self
-compassion, read this e

   V = Values
 Committed
 action 
should be 
guided by your core values: 
What do you want to stand for in 
the face of this crisis? 
What sort of person 
do 
you want to be, a
s you go through 
this
? How 
do you want to treat yourself and others? 
  Your values might 
include
 love, respect, h
umour, pati
ence, courage, honesty,
 caring, 
openness, kindness
 –. 
or numerous o
thers. 
Look for ways to 
‚sprinkle
™ these
 values into 
your day. Let th
em guide and motivate your committed action
.  
Of course, a
s this crisis unfolds, there will be all sorts of obstacles in your life; goals you can™t 
achieve,
 things you can™t do
, problems for which there 
are no simple solution
s. But you can 
still l
ive your 
values
 in a m
yriad of different
 ways, even in the face of all those challenges.
 Especially come back to your values of kindness
 and caring. Consider:
 What are kind
, carin
g ways you can treat yourself as you go through this? 
 What are k
ind words you can say
 to yourself,
 kind deeds you can do
 for yourself?
  What are kind ways you can treat others who are suffering
?  What are kind, caring ways of 
contributing to the wellbeing 
of your community?
 What can you say and do that will enable 
you 
to look back in years to come and feel proud 
of your response
?   I = Identify resources 
 Identify resources for help, assistance, support
, and advice
. This includes friends, family, 
neighbours, health professionals, emergency services.  
And make sure you know the 
emergency helpline phone numbers
, including psychological help if required
.  Also r
each out to your social networks. And if you are able to offer support
 to others, let 
them 
know; you can be a resource for other
 people
, just
 as they can for you
. One
 very important 
aspect of this
 process
 involves finding 
a reliable
 and trustworthy
 source
 of information for updates on the crisis and guidelines for responding to it. 
The World 
Health Organisation website is the leading source of such information: 
https://www.who.
int/emergencies/diseases/novel
-coronavirus
-2019
 Also check the website of your country™s government health department.
  Use this in
formation to d
evelop 
your own resources: 
action plans
 to protect yourself and 
others, and to prepare in advance
 for quarantin
e or emergency
.  D = Disinfect
 & distance 
physically
 I™m sure you already know this, but it™s worth repeating: disinfect your hands regularly and 

practice as much social distancing as realistically possible, for the greater good of your 

community. 
And reme
mber, we™re talking about physical
 distancing 
Œ not cutting off 
emotionally.
 (If you aren™t quite sure 
about what this means, read this: 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel
-coronavirus
-2019/advice
-for
-public
 ) This is an important aspect of committed action, so align it deeply with you
r values; 
recognise that these are truly caring actions.

    In Summary
 So again and again
 and again
, as problems pile up in the world a
round you, and emotional 
storms rage in the world within you, come back to the 
steps of FACE COVID:
 F = Focus on what™s in your control
 A = Acknowledge your thoughts and feelings
 C = Come back into your body
 E = Engage in what you™re doing
  C = Committed ac
tion
 O = Opening up
 V = Values
 I = Identify resources
 D = Disinfect & distance

When do you need help?
 
 

 
When symptoms associated with your anxiety have

TAKING CARE OF YOUR 
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation
During An Infectious Disease Outbreak
What Is Social Distancing?
Social distancing is a way to keep people from in-
teracting closely or frequently enough to spread 
an infectious disease. Schools and other gath-
ering places such as movie theaters may close, 
and sports events and religious services may be 
cancelled.
What Is Quarantine?
Quarantine separates and restricts the move-
ment of people who have been exposed to a 
contagious disease to see if they become sick. It 
lasts long enough to ensure the person has not 
contracted an infectious disease.
What Is Isolation?Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious 
disease by separating people who are sick from-
those who are not.It lasts as long as the disease 
is contagious.
Introduction
In the event of an infectious disease outbreak, local 
officals may require the public to take measures to 
limit and control the spread of the disease. This tip 
sheet provides information about 
social distancing
, quarantine
, and isolation. The government has the 
right to enforce federal and state laws related to 
public health if people within the country get sick 
with highly contagious diseases that have the po-
tential to develop into outbreaks or pandemics.
This tip sheet describes feelings and thoughts you 
may have during and after social distancing, quar-
antine, and isolation. It also suggests ways to care 
Toll-Free: 1-877-SAMHSA-7 (1-877-726-4727) | Info@samhsa.hhs.gov | http://store.samhsa.gov
for your behavioral health during these experiences 
and provides resources for more help.
What To Expect: Typical Reactions
Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such 
as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social 
distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:
Ł Anxiety, worry, or fear related to:
Ł Your own health status
Ł The health status of others whom you may have 
exposed to the disease
Ł The resentment that your friends and family may 
feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result 
of contact with you
Ł The experience of monitoring yourself, or being 
monitored by others for signs and symptoms of 
the diseaseŁ Time taken off from work and the potential loss 
of income and job security
Ł The challenges of securing things you need, 
such as groceries and personal care items
Ł Concern
 about being able to effectively care for 
children or others in your care
Ł Uncertainty or frustration
 about how long you 
will need to remain in this situation, and uncer-
tainty about the future
Ł Loneliness
 associated with feeling cut off from 
the world and from loved ones
Ł Anger if you think you were exposed to the dis-
ease because of others™ negligence
Ł Boredom and frustration 
because you  may not 
be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day 
activitiesŁ Uncertainty or ambivalence
 about the situationŁ A desire
 to use alcohol or drugs to cope
Ł Symptoms of depression,
 such as feelings of 
hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping

Ways To Support Yourself 
During Social Distancing, 
Quarantine, and Isolation
UNDERSTAND THE RISK
Consider the real risk of harm to yourself 
and others around you. The public percep
-tion of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccu
-rate. Media coverage may create the im
-pression that people are in immediate dan
-ger when really the risk for infection may be 
very low. Take steps to get the facts:
 Ł Stay up to date on what is happening, 
while limiting your media exposure. 
Avoid watching or listening to news 
reports 24/7 since this tends to increase 
anxiety and worry. Remember that chil
-dren are especially affected by what they 
hear and see on television.
Ł Look to credible sources for information 
on the infectious disease outbreak (see 
page 3 for sources of reliable out
-break-related information).
BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE
Speaking out about your needs is partic
-ularly important if you are in quarantine, 
since you may not be in a hospital or other 
facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure 
you have what you need to feel safe, secure, 
and comfortable.
Ł Work with local, state, or national health 
officials to find out how you can arrange for 
groceries and toiletries to be delivered to 
your home as needed.
Ł Inform health care providers or health 
authorities of any needed medications and 
work with them to ensure that you continue 
to receive those medications.
EDUCATE YOURSELF
Health care providers and health authorities 
should provide information on the disease, its 
diagnosis, and treatment.
Ł Do not be afraid to ask questionsŠclear 
communication with a health care provider 
may help reduce any distress associated 
with social distancing, quarantine, or isola
-tion.Ł Ask for written information when available.
Ł Ask a family member or friend to obtain 
information in the event that you are unable 
to secure this information on your own.
WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE 
FINANCIAL STRESS
If you™re unable to work during this time, you 
may experience stress related to your job sta
-tus or financial situation. Ł Provide your employer with a clear expla
-nation  of why you are away from work. 
Ł Contact the U.S. Department of Labor toll- 
free at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family 
and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which 
allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of 
unpaid leave for serious medical condi
-tions, or to care for a family member with a

serious medical condition.
ŁContact your utility providers, cable and
Internet provider, and other compa-

nies from whom you get monthly bills

to explain your situation and request

alternative bill payment arrangements

as needed.CONNECT WITH OTHERSReaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression,
loneliness, and boredom during social dis-tancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:
ŁUse the telephone, email, text messag-
ing, and social media to connect with

friends, family, and others.
ŁTalk ﬁface to faceﬂ with friends and loved

ones using Skype or FaceTime.
ŁIf approved by health authorities and

your health care providers, arrange for

your friends and loved ones to bring you

newspapers, movies, and books.
ŁSign up for emergency alerts via text or
email to ensure you get updates as soon as

they are available.
ŁCall SAMHSA™s free 24-hour Disaster Dis-
tress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel

lonely or need support.
ŁUse the Internet, radio, and television to
keep up with local, national, and world

events.
ŁIf you need to connect with someone
because of an ongoing alcohol or drug

problem, consider calling your local Alco-

holics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous

offices.
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
If you are in a medical facility, you may have ac-
cess to health care providers who can answer 

your questions. However, if you are quarantined 

at home, and you™re worried about physical 

symptoms you or your loved ones may be expe-

riencing, call your doctor or other health care 

provider:
ŁAsk your provider whether it would be
possible to schedule remote appointments
via Skype or FaceTime for mental health,

substance use, or physical health needs.
ŁIn the event that your doctor is unavailable
and you are feeling stressed or are in crisis,

call the hotline numbers listed at the end of

this tip sheet for support.
USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX
ŁRelax your body often by doing things that
work for you-take deep breaths, stretch,
meditate or pray, or engage in activities you

enjoy.
ŁPace yourself between stressful activities,
and do something fun after a hard task.
ŁTalk about your experiences and feelings to
loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.
ŁMaintain a sense of hope and positive

AFTER SOCIAL DISTANCING, QUARANTINE, OR 

ISOLATION
You may experience mixed emotions, including 
a sense of relief. If you were isolated because 

you had the illness, you may feel sadness or 

anger because friends and loved ones may have 

unfounded fears of contracting the disease from 

contact with you, even though you have been 

determined not to be contagious.
The best way to end this common fear is to 
learn about the disease and the actual risk to 

others. Sharing this information will often calm 

fears in others and allow you to reconnect with 

them.If you or your loved ones experience symptoms 
of extreme stressŠsuch as trouble sleeping, 

problems with eating too much or too little, 

inability to carry out routine daily activities, 

or using drugs or alcohol to copeŠspeak to a 

health care provider or call one of the hotlines 

listed to the right for a referral.
If you are feeling overwhelmed with emotions such as 
sadness, depression, anxiety, or feel like you want to harm 

yourself or someone  else, call 911 or the National Suicide 

Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).

Back t
o Work Considerations
  The considerations for repatriation of your workforce to the office following COVID 19 has been 
on the minds of most business owners across Iowa, the United States and the world.  In order to 

do so safely, we have to consider what changes must take place t
o protect the physical and 
mental wellbeing of our employees, contractors, vendors and visitors to each of our facilities.  
 We still face many challenges as we look forward to the next few weeks.  Lack of Personal 

Protective Equipment (PPE) for employees,
 shortage of testing for individuals, conflicting 

information on how we handle employees that have tested positive or have been given the 

diagnosis of a presumptive positive are all things that add a complex dynamic to bringing our 

workforce back.  
 We hav
e pulled together ma
ny different resources to provide a
 variety of businesses and 
organizations gui
dance as they address reopening.

     2  General Tips
  General Health Guidelines:
  Encourage staff and employees to take their temperature twice 
a day. Set a baseline 
temperature that, if exceeded, will deny entry to your facility.  Currently, the CDC has set 
the temperature of 100.4 as a guidepost for medical workers
.  Work with staff to encourage handwashing and using hand sanitizer every hour.
  Promote etiqu
ette for coughing, sneezing and handwashing. 
  Encourage staff to wear face masks for homemade cloth face mask to prevent the spread 
of COVID
-19.  General 
Reopening Guidance
:  Use 
CDC guidance related to 
cleaning and d
isinf
ection for community f
acilities
, including frequent cleaning and disinfecting of all high touch surfaces.
  Encourage and provide supplies to allow for frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing 
for employees and the public.
  Provide reminders to employees and members of the public
 to stay at least 6 feet away 
from others when in the facility and mark 
six
-foot
 intervals when possible.
  Post signage at the door indicating no one should enter the establishment if they currently 
have
 symptoms
 or have been around anyone with a confirmed 
COVID
-19 diagnosis in 
the last 14 days.
  If an employee or a member of the public becomes ill while at the facility, ask them to 
share that information with management, leave the facility and then call their health care 
provider.
  Members of the public and e
mployees should consider the use of 
cloth face coverings 
(when practical) if staying at least 6 feet aw
ay from others is not possible.
   Anyone who is
 high risk
 for more severe COVID
-19 illnes
s should continue to stay 
home.
  Businesses should continue to fol
low 
IDPH™s business guidance related to preventing, 
detecting an
d reporting outbreaks.
  Businesses should use
 messaging 
to remind employees of steps they should be taking to 
protect their own health while at work.
      3  General Guidance for All Employees
   Employees should take and log temperature before shifts
 o Best practice: employers to take temperatures onsite with a no
-touch thermometer 
each day upon arrival at work.
 o Minimum: temperatures can be taken before arriving. Normal temperature should 
not exceed
 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Employees should also be screened for COVID
-19 symptoms including: 
fever of 100°F 
or higher, cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle aches
, fatigue, diarrhea or vomiting
. Immediately exclude anyone 
with symptoms from entering.
  Staff should wear face coverings (not N
-95 or medical masks, which should be reserved 
for healthcare workers) and other personal protection items as recommended by the CDC.
  Provide training on personal protective equipment base
d on CDC guidelines.
  Staff will need to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer every hour.
  Practice recommended social distancing to the greatest extent possible
ŠﬁFurther is 

safer.ﬂ
  Stagger shifts, breaks and meals, in compliance with wage and hour laws an
d regulations, 

to maintain social distancing. Consider reduced staffing requirements where possible.
  Prohibit congregating in break rooms or common areas and limit capacity of such areas to 

allow for safe social distancing minimum of 6 feet whenever possib
le.
 o Employees should increase hygiene practices
Šwash hands more frequently, 
avoid touching face, practice good respiratory etiquette when coughing or 

sneezing.
  All employees should stay home if feeling ill, report any symptoms of illness to 

supervisor and 
require notification of COVID
-19 positive case in employee™s household. 
Employees who are particularly vulnerable to COVID
-19 according to the CDC (e.g., due 
to age or underlying conditions) are encouraged to stay home.
  Update the Employee Illness Policy t
o include the symptoms of ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ or create a 
COVID
-19 specific policy. All staff should sign the policy, and the policy should be 
posted for confirmation.
  Post extensive signage on health policies, including the following documents, in the 
workplace to
 help educate building occupants on COVID
-19 best practices.
       4   Workplace Leave Policies
   Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and 
that employees are aware of and understand these policies.
  Maintain 
flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family 
member or take care of children due to school and childcare closures. Additional 
flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave and allowing employees 
to donat
e sick leave to each other.
  Employers that do not currently offer sick leave to some or all of their employees may 
want to draft non
-punitive ﬁemergency sick leaveﬂ policies.
  Employers should not require a positive COVID
-19 test result or a healthcare prov
ider™s 
note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to 
return to work. Healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy 
and not able to provide such documentation in a timely manner.
  Review h
uman resources policies to make sure that policies and practices are consistent 
with public health recommendations and are consistent with existing state and federal 
workplace laws (for more information on employer responsibilities, visit th
e Department 
of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website.  
  Connect employees to employee assistance program (EAP) resources (if available) and 
community resources as needed. Employees may need additional social, behavioral, and 
other services, for examp
le, to cope with the death of a loved one.

.     7   Cleaning and disinfecting your building or facility if someone is sick
  Close off areas
 used by the person who is sick.
 o Companies do not necessarily need to close operations, if they can close off 
affected 
areas.
  Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans
 to increase air circulation in the 
area.
  Wait 24 hours
 before you clean or disinfect. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as 
possible.
  Clean and disinfect
 all areas used by the 
person who is sick
, such as offices, bathrooms, 
common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote 
controls, and ATM machines.
  Once area has been
 appropriately disinfected
, it
 can be opened for use
. o Workers without clo
se contact
 with the person who is sick can return to work 
immediately after disinfection.
  If more than 7 days
 since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional 
cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.
 o Continue routine cleaning and di
sinfection. This includes everyday practices that 
businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment.
 Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas
  Outdoor areas, like
 playgrounds in schools and parks
 generally require
 normal routine 
cleaning
, but do not require disinfection.
 o Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds
- it is not an efficient use of 
supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID
-19 to the public.
 o High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars 
and railings 
should be cleaned routinely.
 o Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or 
groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended.
  Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected.
 o Spread of COVID
-19 from these surface
s is very low and disinfection is not 
effective.
  8   When cleaning
  Regular cleaning staff
 can clean and disinfect community spaces.
 o Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals.
  Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all 
tasks in the cleaning process, including 
handling trash
. o Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the 
cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.
 o Gloves and gowns should be removed caref
ully to avoid contamination of the 
wearer and the surrounding area.
  Wash your hands often
 with soap and water for 20 seconds.
 o Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person 
who is sick.
 o Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are n
ot available and hands are not visibly dirty, 
an alcohol
-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. 
However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.
  Additional key times to wash hands
 include:
 o After blow
ing one™s nose, coughing, or sneezing.
 o After using the restroom.
 o Before eating or preparing food.
 o After contact with animals or pets.
 o Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance 
(e.g., a child).
 Additional Considerations
 for Employers
  Educate workers
 performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick
-up to recognize the 
symptoms of COVID
-19.  Ensure workers are
 trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals
 used in the 
workplace in accordance with OSHA™s Hazard Communication 
standard.
  Comply
 with OSHA™s standards on Bloodborne Pathogens), including proper disposal of 
regulated waste, and PPE.
 Alternative Disinfection Methods
  The efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity 
UV radiation
, and LED blue light against COVID
-19 virus is not known.
 9  o EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as 
UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm 
whether, or under what circumstances, 
such products might be effective against 
the spread of COVID
-19.  CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they 
are effective in reducing the spread of COVID
-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels 
could cause skin, e
ye, or respiratory irritation or damage.
  CDC only recommends use of the
 EPA approved cleaners
 against the virus that causes 
COVID
-19.     
       
       
  10   Industry Specific Reopening Guidelines
  Dining and Bars
 It is critical that restaurant personnel review, and restaurants 
must
 ensure the following 
mandatory requirements
 included in the governor™s proclamation are in place and enforced: 
   Limit indoor and outdoor seating capacity to 50 percent of normal operating capacity. 
  Limit group size to no more than six people. 
  Arrange seating to provide a minimum of six feet between tables. 
  Disallow customer self
-service of food or beverages, incl
uding buffets and salad bars. 
  Implement reasonable measures to ensure social distancing of employees and customers, 
increased hygiene practices, and other public health measures to reduce the risk of 

transmission of COVID
-19.   
Additionally, the Iowa Depa
rtment of Inspections and Appeals and the Iowa Department of 
Public Health 
strongly recommend that all restaurants adhere to the following guidance
:    To the extent possible, eliminate seating at bars within restaurants. 
  Eliminate entertainment operations or activities. 
  Serve alcohol to a guest only if the guest is also ord
ering and consuming food items.
  Disinfect tables and chairs after each customer use. 
  Clean and sanitize table condiments, reusable menus, digital orde
ring devices, check 
presenters, pens, napkin dispensers, salt and pepper shakers, and other commonly
-touched items between each customer use. 
  Use prewrapped silverware and eliminate table presets including table tents, menus, salt 

and pepper shakers, napk
in dispensers, and condiments. 
  Eliminate refilling customer beverages from common containers (i.e., pitchers). 
   Discard single
-use or paper articles, such as paper menus, after each use. 
  Create and implement an enhanced cleaning/sanitizing schedule for 
all food contact 

surfaces, and cleaning/disinfecting of non
-food contact surfaces. 
  Disinfect commonly
-touched surfaces throughout entire facility (both front and back
-of-house) such as door handles, credit card machines, bathrooms, etc., at least once eve
ry 
hour. 
  11    To the extent possible, on
-premises dining should be by reservation only and customers 
should be screened upon reservation and arrival as to whether anyone in the party is 
positive, has any symptoms, is under quarantine, or has been exposed to 
COVID
-19.   Post signage on entrance door that no one with a fever or symptoms of COVID
-19 will be 
permitted in the restaurant. 
  Screen all employees each shift before entering the facility for symptoms (i.e., fever of 

100°F or higher, cough, shortness of b
reath, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle 

aches, fatigue, diarrhea, or vomiting). Immediately exclude anyone with symptoms from 

entering. 
  Where possible, workstations should be staggered to avoid employees standing directly 

opposite one another or 
next to each other, and maintain six feet of social distance.
  Require employees with direct customer contact to w
ear cloth or other mask that is 
laundered or replaced daily. 
  Frequently monitor employee handwashing and ensure no bare hand contact with read
y-to-eat foods. 
  Notify customers by signage to report concerns of social distancing infractions to the 
restaurant manager. 
  Use technological solutions where possible to reduce person
-to-person interaction (e.g. 
mobile ordering, mobile access to menus to 
plan in advance, text on arrival for seating, 
contactless payment options). 
  Enhance employee safety training, emphasizing employee health, handwashing, and 

personal hygiene practices. 
  Have hand sanitizer and sanitizing products readily available for empl
oyees and 
customers. 
  Designate with signage, tape, or by other means appropriate social distancing spacing for 

employees and customers. Facilitate and designate social distancing for those waiting to 

enter your establishment. 
  If possible, provide distinc
t walking lanes to minimize close contact as customers are 
being seated to conform to social distancing practices. For example, in a table/booth 

layout, central tables can be removed, and markings can be installed designating the path 

for seating. 
  Assign an employee each shift to monitor social distancing, sanitation, and hygiene 

protocols.

ﬁsuper settingﬂ) so that machines 
are cleaned after use
  Consider limiting workout length to avoid unnecessary exposure, decrease congestion, 

and allow for additional sanitization
  Recommend that persons more vulnerable or at
-risk for  COVID
-19 as identified by the 
CDC
Šincluding those who ar
e over the age of 65 or those who have chronic medical 
conditions
Štake extra precaution or refrain 
from use of the facility.
  
Business Process Adaptations
  Restrict facility access to staffed hours only (i.e., any unmanned facilities must be 

manned) and lim
it facility occupancy to 50 percent of capacity as dictated by fire code 
(as such capacity is adjusted in consideration of closed areas of the facility pursuant to 
these guidelines).
  Mitigate exposure in the workplace by implementing social distancing guid
elines and 
modify scheduling.
  Staff to conduct regular (i.e., every 2 hours) disinfecting of high
-touch surfaces, 
equipment and common areas of the facility using disinfectant cleaning supplies 

according to CDC guidelines.
  Close showers, locker rooms, and 
lockers until further notice. Ask customers to instead 
use small gym bags to store personal belongings; remind customers to appropriately 

monitor or secure such personal belongs or provide a secure area monitored by staff.
  Close all swimming pools, hot tub
s, saunas and other recreational water or spa facilities.
  Close all basketball courts, racquetball courts, and other places where formal and 

informal group or team sports may occur.
  Any youth or adult team leagues or sports should remain closed.
 17   Only allow
 group fitness classes if classes can be completed in accordance with social 
distancing recommendations (including but not limited to: less than 50% capacity and 
with more than 6 feet of distance maintained between participants at all times; no shared 
equi
pment during the class; sufficiently adjusted class schedules to allow for deep 
cleaning between classes; martial arts and other contact activities should be completed 

without any person
-to-person contact).
  Encourage all employees and customers to wear PPE
 where applicable, and recommend 
that customers wear a face covering (not N
-95 or medical masks, which should be 
reserved for healthcare workers).
  Adjust equipment layout and close or restrict access to equipment to maintain at least six 
feet of distance b
etween equipment.
  Temporarily close water fountains, common areas, break rooms, check
-in counters, 
where customers or employees may congregate. Encourage users to provide their own 
water.
  No self
-service options (coffee bars, smoothie stations and other fo
rms of communal food 
in facilities). Food retail should follow restaurant guidelines.
  Ensure that staffing of facilities is sufficient to enable enhanced sanitization and cleaning 
measures.
         
      18  Legal Considerations of ﬁBack to Workﬂ
  Generally 
Speaking:
 Employers may face liability under O
ccupational 
Safety and 
Health 
Administration (OSHA)
 regulations for actions taken before, during and after the COVID
-19 crisis.
 Although there is no 
ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ standard, several OSHA standards could be applied to preventing the spread of the 
disease.  This includes, but is not limited to, the ﬁGeneral Duty Clauseﬂ which requires 
employers to provide their workers ﬁ
employment and a
 place of employment, which are free 
from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ
 29 USC 654(a)(1)
 Though it would be difficult for an employee to clearly demonstrate that they contracted the 

illness whil
e at their place of employment, contact tracing could lay a clear path back to the 

workplace.  
 As we begin to repatriate our offices and bring the workforce back, there are many additional 

considerations that may impact decisions.  There is always a chanc
e that employers may face 
claims of discrimination while making difficult choices in how they phase in the returning work 
force.  
It is impera
tive that such decisions are made for reasons
 not based on a protected cl
ass as 
defined by
 discrimination laws. 
Specifically, employers need to
 careful
ly document their 
selection process and avoid making any 
decisions based on
 age or disabilities that might be 
perceived to 
make an employee or applicant more vulnerable to the virus.
 For businesses that are forced to ma
ke a reduction in work force, these same types of 

considerations should be applied.  Employees that used sick leave to care for family members or 

because of concerns about their own well
-being that are later part of a force reduction may 
consider this a re
taliation or retribution by the employer.  
 Personal Protective Equipment:
 Many employers are considering placement of policies or protocols that include the wearing of 

facemasks, gloves or other protective equipment to help stop the spread of any illness 
in their 
workplace.  
While the intent is well placed, certain considerations should be made:
  Have you accounted for those with access and functional needs?  This may include things 
like protective wear for those who use wheelchairs, options for those with 
allergies to 
latex, etc.  
  Have you provided proper training for use of the protective wear? Improper donning and 
doffing of protective equipment is often the cause of infection among medical 

professionals.  
  Can you provide fit testing for masks?  
 Legall
y, if the employer can accommodate these types of exceptions or alternatives without 
causing undue hardship to the business, they are required to do so.  
 19   Screening and other access controls
 Even those things that are intende
d to protect the work force 
may cause legal issues if not 
completed correctly.  Currently, under the medical emergency, leniencies have been provided 
to companies in the interest of protecting the general public from COVID
-19. As the disaster continues and a new normal emerges, there
 may be a review of these 
procedures which may cause problems if not implemented correctly.
 Some basic steps may help to protect companies:
 1. Decide who you will screen.  While some companies are screening ALL employees, 
others are screening only those who 
have been in contact with someone who has been 
tested positive for COVID 19.  Many companies are testing everyone who enters the 
facility while others do not have that option (retail stores and others with rotating 
customer base where it would be impractic
al).  One of the most important considerations 
is consistency and assurance that the testing is completed on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 2. Training for those who are doing the screening.  Again, there are differences in how 

companies are doing the screening. 
 Some companies are allowing employees to take 
their own temperature while others are providing a trained employee to take all 

temperatures.  Still others are hiring third party contractors for this purpose.  Whichever 
method you choose, maintain records t
o ensure discrimination has not taken place. 
 3. Safety Concerns and Requirements.  Ensure that those taking temperatures are provided 
proper personal protective equipment.
 4. Equipment.  Consider what type of thermometers will be used and be consistent.  Speed,
 
accuracy and ease of use are main considerations for most of the businesses 
implementing checks.  
 5. Decide where checks will take place.  The main consideration is privacy.  The best 

location would allow some discretion for the person being screened.  Idea
lly, there would 
be an alternate location that anyone failing the screening could be taken to walk them 

though the next steps.
 6. Develop a screening process or policy and stick to it. 
 7. Develop a documentation process.
 8. Communicate the processes to your employ
ees prior to implementation.
 9. Send employees home if they have a fever or if they refuse to be tested.  Communicate 
this to employees prior to beginning the testing process.  If an employee is sent home, 
provide them with instructions or expectations (call 
their primary care provider, get tested 
if possible, etc.)
.  Follow up periodically with employees that are sent home.
 10. Establish return to work procedure and communicate that with employees.  Written 

policy should be sent with anyone that is sent home.  So
me considerations may include:
 a. Cannot return to work unless at least 10 days has passed since onset of symptoms
 b. Cannot return to work until at least 72 hours after employee has experienced no 
fever
 20  c. Has been completely symptom free for at least 72 hours. 
 Legal implications related to the return to the office are endless.  The protection of employer and 
employee are mutually beneficial and both need to be considered for a successful restart of our 
companies and our economy.  
It™s important to actively engage
 your legal department or other 
counsel early in your processes.
                   
   
 21  Return to Work: Mental Health Supports for Employees and Families 
  Your example and leadership are vital to your company™s recovery and Return
-to-Work plan 
success. 
 Workplaces in crisis impacts team function and employee wellbeing. Including social and 
emotional health in business strategies positions companies to emerge stronger and more 

resilient, with staff who feel supported and more connected to their company and
 their 

colleagues. 
 The information below can serve as a guide in helping you address some of the keystones in 

supporting employee mental health and wellbeing in your Return
-to-Work plan. 
 Resilience vs Burnout
 An important component of managing crisis is 
monitoring the stress of your employees. The 

World Health Organization defines burnout as a ﬁsyndrome conceptualized as resulting from 

chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.ﬂ Employees suffering from 

burnout have higher rates of 
  Alcohol or substance abuse 
  Broken relationships 
  Poor physical health
  Anxiety or Depression
  Suicidal ideation
 Leaders can build supports for themselves and their employees to reduce the risk of burnout and 

the negative behaviors associated that impact work and family life. 
  Improve social supports while maintaining physically distancing. Building and 

maintaining s
trong social connections in the workplace reduces risks associated 
with feelings of isolation, disconnection, or loneliness. 
Ask managers to 
prioritize regular, less formal contact with staff in their Return
-to-Work 
planning. 
  Resilience is the ability to cope despite difficult situations. Building resilience 
takes teamwork, courage, and patience. 
In your Return
-to-Work plan, 
encourage employees to ask for help when the need it; offer help to others; 
and find positive ways to de
compress. 
(see Appendix xxx Resilience Wheel)
  Set the example. 
  Monitor employee fatigue/burnout
 during the Return
-to- Work transition, 
especially those engaged in helping others. 
Include respite in your Return
-to-Work plan
 to recharge staff and reduce the
 negative impact of chronic or toxic 
stress. (see Appendix xxx for the Professional Quality of Life Scale Assessment)
  22  Connect Staff to Mental Health Resources
 Everyone needs help sometime. Directing staff to resources and prioritizing their mental and 
emo
tional wellbeing shows them you understand the toll of the many changes in workplace 
routines. 
  Recognize the challenges of uncertain times in business and family life facing all 
of us.  
Assure staff that while episodes of anxiety, fear, or depression may 
occur, company and/or community resources are available to support the 
individual and their family.
  o Include emotional wellbeing as a priority in your company™s COVID 

recovery planning
 o Identify key staff as a point of contact for more information on access
ing 
mental health supports
 o Post mental health warm
-line and crisis information (see Appendix xxx for 
a list of resources)
  Review employee health insurance plans; 
ensure access to mental health 
supports is available under your employee benefit plan.
  Tele
-health services allow employees to access mental health providers without 
leaving their workplace or home. 
Ask your insurer about telemedicine access 
and rate parity within your insurance plan.

ort can be found here:

YOUR SCORES ON THE PROQOL: PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE SCREENING 
Based on your responses, place 
your personal scores below. If you have any 
concerns, you should 
discuss them with a 
physical or mental health care professional. 
 Compassion Satisfaction _____________ Compassion satisfaction is about the pleasure you derive from 
being able to do your work well. For example, you may feel 
like it is a pleasure to help others through your work. Yo
u may feel positively about your
 colleagues or your ability to 
contribute to the work setting or even 
the greater good of society. Higher s
cores on this scale represent a greater 
satisfaction related to your ability to be an effective caregiver in your job. 
The average score is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .88). About 25% of people score higher than 57 and about 25% of 
people score below 43. If you are in the higher range, you pr
obably derive a good deal of professional satisfaction from 
your position. If your scores are below 40, you may either fi
nd problems with your job, or there may be some other 
reasonŠfor example, you might 
derive your satisfaction from activities other than your job. 
 Burnout_____________ Most people have an intuitive idea of what burnout is. From 
the research perspective, burnout is one of the elements of 
Compassion Fatigue (CF). It is associated 
with feelings of hopelessne
ss and difficulties in dealing 
with work or in doing your 
job effectively. These negative feelings usually have a gradual on
set. They can reflect the feeling that your efforts make no 
difference, or they can be associated with a very high work
load or a non-supportive work 
environment. Higher scores on 
this scale mean that you are at higher risk for burnout. 
The average score on the burnout scale is 50 (SD 10; alpha sc
ale reliability .75). About 25% of people score above 57 and 
about 25% of people score below 43. If your score is below 43, 
this probably reflects positive feelings about your ability to 
be effective in your work. If you score above 57 you may wish to think about what at work makes you feel like you are not 
effective in your position. Your score may reflect your mood; pe
rhaps you were having a ﬁbad dayﬂ or are in need of some 
time off. If the high score persists or if it is reflective of other worries, it may be a cause for concern. 
 Secondary Traumatic Stress_____________ The second component of Compassion Fati
gue (CF) is secondary traumatic stress (STS). It is about your work related, 
secondary exposure to extremely or traumatically stressful events. Developing problems due to exposure to other™s 
trauma is somewhat rare but does happen to many peop
le who care for those who have experienced extremely or 
traumatically stressful events. For example, you may repeatedly
 hear stories about the traumatic things that happen to 
other people, commonly called Vicarious Traumatization. If your work
 puts you directly in the path of danger, for example, 
field work in a war or area of civil violence, this is not se
condary exposure; your exposure is primary. However, if you are 
exposed to others™ traumatic events as a result of your work, 
for example, as a therapist or 
an emergency worker, this is 
secondary exposure. The symptoms of STS are usually rapid in
 onset and associated with a particular event. They may 
include being afraid, having difficulty sleeping, having images 
of the upsetting event pop into your mind, or avoiding things 
that remind you of the event. 
The average score on this scale is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .81). About 25% of people score below 43 and about 
25% of people score above 57. If your score is above 57, you ma
y want to take some time to think about what at work may 
be frightening to you or if there is some
 other reason for the elevated score. While
 higher scores do not mean that you do 
have a problem, they are an indication
 that you may want to examine how you
 feel about your work and your work 
environment. You may wish to discuss this with your su
pervisor, a colleague, or a health care professional.

  Return to Work: 
Mental Health Supports for Employee
s and Families 
 Your example and leadership are vital to your company™s recovery and Return
-to-Work plan success. 
 Workplaces 
in crisis impact
s team function and employee wellbeing
. Including social and emotional 
health in business strategies positions companies to emerge stronger
 and more resilient, with staff who 
feel supported and more connected to their company and their colleagues. 
 The information below can serve as a guide 
in helping you address some of the keystones in supporting 
employee mental health
 and wellbeing
 in your Return
-to-Work plan
.  Resilience vs Burnout
 An important component of managing crisis is 
monitoring the stress of your employees. 
The World 
Health Organiz
ation defines burnout as a ﬁsyndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace 
stress that has not been successfully managed
.ﬂ Employees suffering from burnout have higher rates of 
  Alcohol or substance abuse 
  Broken relationships 
  Poor physical 
health
  Anxiety
 or
 Depression
  Suicidal ideation
 Leaders can build supports for themselves and their employees to reduce the risk of burnout
 and the 
negative behaviors associated that impact work and family life
.   Improve social supports while maintaining 
physically distancing.
 Building and 
maintaining strong social connections in the workplace reduces risks associated with 
feelings of isolation, disconnection, or loneliness. 
Ask managers to prioritize regular, 
less formal contact with staff in their Return
-to-Work planning. 
  Resilience is the ability to cope despite difficult situations. Building resilience takes 
teamwork, courage, and patience. 
In your Return
-to-Work plan, encourage employees 
to ask for help when the need it; offer help to others; and find
 positive ways to 
decompress.
 (see Appendix xxx Resilience Wheel)
  Set the example. 
  Monitor employee fatigue/burnout
 during the Return
-to- Work transition, especially 
those engaged in helping others. 
Include respite in your Return
-to-Work plan
 to 
recharge 
staff and reduce the negative impact of chronic or toxic stress. 
(see Appendix 
xxx for the 
Professional Quality of Life Scale Assessment
) Connect Staff to Mental Health Resources
 Everyone needs help sometime
. Directing staff to resources and prioritizing t
heir mental and emotional 
wellbeing shows them you 
understand the 
toll
 of the many changes in workplace routines. 
  Recognize the challenges of uncertain times in business and family life facing all of us.  
Assure staff that while episodes of anxiety, fear,
 or depression may occur, company 
and/or community resources are available to support the individual and their family.
  o Include emotional wellbeing as a priority in your company™s COVID recovery 
planning
 o Identify key staff as a point of contact for more in
formation on accessing mental 
health supports
 o Post mental health warm
-line and crisis information 
(see Appendix xxx for a list 
of resources)
  Review employee health insurance plans; 
ensure access to mental health supports is 
available
 under your employee benefit plan.
  Tele
-health services allow employees to access mental health providers without leaving 
their workplace or home. 
Ask your insurer about telemedicine access and rate parity
 within your insurance plan

The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds h
as issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should co
ntact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, t
esting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

includes mechanisms used to provide support to local 
jurisdictions both for unplanned emergency incidents and planned events alike.  
The following subsections provide a 
briefing of activities by emergency support function.

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds h
as issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should co
ntact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, t
esting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

This is a fast

CIEMSD is coordinating the PLEXA and PCFCA to identify responder housing needs if they need to be isolated 
and/or quarantined, if they have childcare needs that
 
would allow them to be able to work or unique work hours that 
would require childcare.
 
They are also coordinating to look ahead and plan for staffing shortages, impact on mutual 
aid and radio interoperability. 
Numbers have been collated for housing and ch
ildcare. 
Alternative housing locations 
have been identified. MOUs/MOAs are in progress.
 
The primary location for emergency responder alternative 
housing is prepared and ready to receive responders, if needed. PSAPs have been integrated into the Emergency 
S
ervices Group within Operations. They were provided a surge plan by the Emergency Services Group that outlined 
the processes that should be implemented in the event of major staffing shortfalls. PSAPs were requested to design a 
coordinated dispatch protoco
l for interoperability, which is currently in progress.
 
An Assess and Refer protocol that 
would allow for EMS to transport patients to alternative locations other than hospitals has been approved and 
implemented.

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds h
as issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should co
ntact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, t
esting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds ha
s issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should con
tact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, te
sting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

Public health preparedness will limit the scope of the disease spread (Phase 1)
 
2.
 
It is likely that a localized outbreak wi

3.
 
Polk County may experience community spread of the disease (Phase 3)
 
4.
 
Polk County Public Health may not be informed of a positive case or tests submitted
 
5.
 
Resources such as personal protective equipment will be very limited 
and possibly unavailable
 
6.
 
Sharing of valid information with community partners and the public will ease fears and drive appropriate 
actions

This is a fast

The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds h
as issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should co
ntact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, t
esting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds h
as issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should co
ntact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, t
esting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

Polk County Public Health may not be informed of a positive case or tests submitted
 
5.
 
Resources such as personal protective equipment will be very limited
 
and possibly unavailable
 
6.

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds ha
s issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should con
tact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, te
sting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

1.
 
Public health preparedness will limit the scope of the disease spread (Phase 1)
 
2.
 
It is likely that a localized outbreak wi
ll occur in Polk County (Phase 2)
 
3.
 
Polk County may experience community spread of the disease (Phase 3)
 
4.
 
Polk County Public Health may not be informed of a positive case or tests submitted
 
5.
 
Resources such as personal protective equipment will be very limited 
and possibly unavailable
 
6.
 
Sharing of valid information with community partners and the public will ease fears and drive appropriate 
actions
 
7.
 
This is a fast
-
paced and evolving incident and information will change and require updating on a frequent

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds ha
s issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should con
tact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, te
sting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds ha
s issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should con
tact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, te
sting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

Public health preparedness will limit the scope of the disease spread (Phase 1)
 
2.
 
It is likely that a localized outbreak wi

Polk County Public Health may not be informed of a positive case or tests submitted
 
5.
 
Resources such as personal protective equipment will be very limited 
and possibly unavailable
 
6.
 
Sharing of valid information with community partners and the public will ease fears and drive appropriate 
actions

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds ha
s issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should con
tact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, te
sting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds ha
s issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should con
tact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, te
sting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds ha
s issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should con
tact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, te
sting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds ha
s issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should con
tact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, te
sting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

ESCRIPTION
 
 
The COVID
-
19 is a world
-
wide pandemic according to the World Health Organization. The President of 
the United States of America has declared a Public Health Emergency and has issued an Emergency 
Declaration. Within Iowa, Governor Reynolds ha
s issued a public health emergency proclamation. All of 
these declarations and proclamations have relaxed various authorities and regulations to respond to this 
incident. Those changes will continue to be assessed and may be altered. Individuals should con
tact their 
respective authorities for those changes.
 
 
Currently, in Iowa, we have community spread, which means that people are becoming infected in ways 
that cannot be traced back to travel or known infected individuals.
 
 
Personal protective equipment, te
sting, screening and surveillance guidelines and recommendations 
continue to be evaluated and are adjusted frequently as more information is gathered about this virus. 
Current guidelines should be sourced from Polk County Health Department's webpage.

 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease 
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has spread from China to 
many other countries around the world, including the United 
States. Depending on the severity of COVID-19™s international 
impacts, outbreak conditionsŠincluding those rising to the level 
of a pandemicŠcan affect all aspects of daily life, including 
travel, trade, tourism, food supplies, and ˜nancial markets.
To reduce the impact of COVID-19 outbreak conditions on 
businesses, workers, customers, and the public, it is important 
for all employers to plan now for COVID-19. For employers who 
have already planned for in˚uenza pandemics, planning for 
COVID-19 may involve updating plans to address the speci˜c 
exposure risks, sources of exposure, routes of transmission, 
and other unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., compared 
to pandemic in˚uenza viruses). Employers who have not 
prepared for pandemic events should prepare themselves 
and their workers as far in advance as possible of potentially 
worsening outbreak conditions. Lack of continuity planning can 
result in a cascade of failures as employers attempt to address 
challenges of COVID-19 with insuf˜cient resources and workers 
who might not be adequately trained for jobs they may have to 
perform under pandemic conditions.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
developed this COVID-19 planning guidance based on traditional 
infection prevention and industrial hygiene practices. It focuses on 
the need for employers to implement engineering, administrative, 
and work practice controls and personal protective equipment 
(PPE), as well as considerations for doing so.
This guidance is intended for planning purposes. Employers 
and workers should use this planning guidance to help 
identify risk levels in workplace settings and to determine 
any appropriate control measures to implement. Additional 
guidance may be needed as COVID-19 outbreak conditions 
change, including as new information about the virus, its 
transmission, and impacts, becomes available.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION4The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services™ Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides the 
latest information about COVID-19 and the global outbreak: 
www.
 cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov
.The OSHA COVID-19 webpage offers information speci˜cally 
for workers and employers: 
www.osha.gov/covid-19
.This guidance is advisory in nature and informational in 
content. It is not a standard or a regulation, and it neither 
creates new legal obligations nor alters existing obligations 
created by OSHA standards or the 
Occupational Safety and 
Health Act
 (OSH Act). Pursuant to the OSH Act, employers 
must comply with safety and health standards and regulations 
issued and enforced either by OSHA or by an OSHA-approved 
State Plan. In addition, the OSH Act™s General Duty Clause, 
Section 5(a)(1)
, requires employers to provide their employees 
with a workplace free from recognized hazards likely to cause 
death or serious physical harm. OSHA-approved State Plans 
may have standards, regulations and enforcement policies that 
are different from, but at least as effective as, OSHA™s. Check 
with your 
State Plan
, as applicable, for more information. 
About COVID-19
Symptoms of COVID-19
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can 
cause illness ranging from mild to severe and, in some cases, 
can be fatal. Symptoms typically include fever, cough, and 
shortness of breath. Some people infected with the virus have 
reported experiencing other non-respiratory symptoms. Other 
people, referred to as 
asymptomatic cases
, have experienced 
no symptoms at all.
According to the CDC, symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in 
as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-195How COVID-19 Spreads
Although the ˜rst human cases of COVID-19 likely resulted 
from exposure to infected animals, infected people can spread 
SARS-CoV-2 to other people.
The virus is thought to 
spread mainly from person-
to-person, including:
 Between people who 
are
 in close contact 
with
 one another (within 
about 6 feet).
 Through respiratory 
droplets produced when an infected person coughs or 
sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of 
people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching 
a surface or object that has SARS-CoV-2 on it and then 
touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this 
is not thought to be the primary way the virus spreads.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are most 
symptomatic (i.e., experiencing fever, cough, and/or shortness 
of breath). Some spread might be possible before people 
show symptoms; there have been reports of this type of 
asymptomatic transmission with this new coronavirus, but this 
is also not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Although the United States has implemented public health 
measures to limit the spread of the virus, it is likely that some 
person-to-person transmission will continue to occur. 
The CDC website provides the latest information about 
COVID-19 transmission: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
about/transmission.html
.Medium exposure risk
 jobs
 include those that 
require frequent and/or 
close contact with (i.e., 
within 6 feet of) other people 
who may
 be
 infected
 with 
SARS
-CoV-2.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION6How a COVID-19 Outbreak Could 
Affect
 Workplaces
Similar to in˚uenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes 
COVID-19, has the potential to cause extensive outbreaks. 

Under conditions associated with widespread person-to-

person spread, multiple areas of the United States and other 

countries may see impacts at the same time. In the absence 

of a vaccine, an outbreak may also be an extended event. As a 

result, workplaces may experience: 
 Absenteeism
. Workers could be absent because they are 
sick; are caregivers for sick family members; are caregivers 

for children if schools or day care centers are closed; have 

at-risk people at home, such as immunocompromised 

family members; or are afraid to come to work because of 

fear of possible exposure. 
 Change in patterns of commerce
. Consumer demand for 
items related to infection prevention (e.g., respirators) is 

likely to increase signi˜cantly, while consumer interest in 
other goods may decline. Consumers may also change 
shopping patterns because of a COVID-19 outbreak. 

Consumers may try to shop at off-peak hours to reduce 

contact with other people, show increased interest in home 

delivery services, or prefer other options, such as drive-

through service, to reduce person-to-person contact. 
 Interrupted supply/delivery
. Shipments of items from 
geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be 

delayed or cancelled with or without noti˜cation.

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reveals

the spikes that adorn the outer surface of 
the virus, which impart the look of a corona 
surrounding the virion, when viewed electron 
microscopically. This virus was identi˜ed as 
the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness 

˜rst detected in Wuhan, China.

GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-197Steps All Employers Can Take to 
Reduce
 Workers™ Risk of Exposure 
to
 SARS-CoV-2
This section describes basic steps that every employer can 
take to reduce the risk of worker exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the 
virus that causes COVID-19, in their workplace. Later sections 
of this guidanceŠincluding those focusing on jobs classi˜ed 
as having low, medium, high, and very high exposure risksŠ
provide speci˜c recommendations for employers and workers 
within speci˜c risk categories.
Develop an Infectious Disease Preparedness 
and Response Plan
If one does not already exist, develop an infectious disease 
preparedness and response plan that can help guide protective 
actions against COVID-19.
Stay abreast of guidance from federal, state, local, tribal, and/or 
territorial health agencies, and consider how to incorporate those 
recommendations and resources into workplace-speci˜c plans.
Plans should consider and address the level(s) of risk 
associated with various worksites and job tasks workers 
perform at those sites. Such considerations may include:
 Where, how, and to what sources of SARS-CoV-2 might 
workers be exposed, including:
 The general public, customers, and coworkers; and
 Sick individuals or those at particularly high risk 
of infection (e.g., international travelers who have 
visited locations with widespread sustained (ongoing) 
COVID-19 transmission, healthcare workers who have 
had unprotected exposures to people known to have, or 
suspected of having, COVID-19).
 Non-occupational risk factors at home and in community 
settings.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION8 Workers™ individual risk factors (e.g., older age; 
presence of chronic medical conditions, including 
immunocompromising conditions; pregnancy).
 Controls necessary to address those risks.
Follow federal and state, local, tribal, and/or territorial (SLTT) 
recommendations regarding development of contingency 
plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks, 
such as:
 Increased rates of worker absenteeism.
 The need for social distancing, staggered work shifts, 
downsizing operations, delivering services remotely, and 
other exposure-reducing measures.
 Options for conducting essential operations with a reduced 
workforce, including cross-training workers across different 
jobs in order to continue operations or deliver surge services.
 Interrupted supply chains or delayed deliveries.
Plans should also consider and address the other steps that 
employers can take to reduce the risk of worker exposure to 
SARS-CoV-2 in their workplace, described in the sections below.
Prepare to Implement Basic Infection 
Prevention Measures
For most employers, protecting workers will depend on 
emphasizing basic infection prevention measures. As 
appropriate, all employers should implement good hygiene 
and infection control practices, including: 
 Promote frequent and thorough 
hand washing
, including 
by providing workers, customers, and worksite visitors with 
a place to wash their hands. If soap and running water are 
not immediately available, provide alcohol-based hand rubs 
containing at least 60% alcohol.
 Encourage workers to 
stay home if they are sick
.  Encourage 
respiratory etiquette
, including covering coughs 
and sneezes.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-199 Provide customers and the public with tissues and trash 
receptacles.
 Employers should explore whether they can establish 
policies and practices
, such as ˚exible worksites (e.g., 
telecommuting) and ˚exible work hours (e.g., staggered 
shifts), to increase the physical distance among 
employees and between employees and others if state 
and local health authorities recommend the use of social 
distancing strategies. 
 Discourage workers from using other workers™ phones, desks, 
of˜ces, or other work tools and equipment, when possible.
 Maintain regular housekeeping practices, including routine 
cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, equipment, and 
other elements of the work environment. When choosing 
cleaning chemicals, employers should consult information 
on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved 
disinfectant labels with claims against emerging viral 
pathogens. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral 
pathogens claims are expected
 to be effective against 
SARS-CoV-2 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow 
the manufacturer™s instructions for use of all cleaning and 
disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application 
method and contact time, PPE). 
Develop Policies and Procedures for Prompt 
Identi˜cation and Isolation of Sick People, 
if
 Appropriate
 Prompt identi˜cation and isolation of potentially infectious 
individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, 
customers, visitors, and others at a worksite.
 Employers should inform and encourage employees to 
self-monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 if they 
suspect possible exposure. 
 Employers should develop policies and procedures for 
employees to report when they are sick or experiencing 
symptoms of COVID-19. 
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION10 Where appropriate, employers should develop policies 
and procedures for immediately isolating people who have 
signs and/or symptoms
 of COVID-19, and train workers to 
implement them. Move potentially infectious people to a 
location away from workers, customers, and other visitors. 
Although most worksites do not have speci˜c isolation 
rooms, designated areas with closable doors may serve as 
isolation rooms until potentially sick people can be removed 
from the worksite. 
 Take steps to limit spread of the respiratory secretions of 
a person who may have COVID-19. Provide a face mask, 
if feasible and available, and ask the person to wear it, if 
tolerated. Note: A face mask (also called a surgical mask, 
procedure mask, or other similar terms) on a patient or 
other sick person should not be confused with PPE for 
a worker; the mask acts to contain potentially infectious 
respiratory secretions at the source (i.e., the person™s nose 
and mouth).
 If possible, isolate people suspected of having COVID-19 
separately from those with con˜rmed cases of the virus 
to prevent further transmissionŠparticularly in worksites 
where medical screening, triage, or healthcare activities 
occur, using either permanent (e.g., wall/different room) or 
temporary barrier (e.g., plastic sheeting).
 Restrict the number of personnel entering isolation areas.
 Protect workers in close contact with (i.e., within 6 feet of) 
a sick person or who have prolonged/repeated contact 
with such persons by using additional engineering and 
administrative controls, safe work practices, and PPE. 
Workers whose activities involve close or prolonged/
repeated contact with sick people are addressed further in 
later sections covering workplaces classi˜ed at medium and 
very high or high exposure risk.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1911Develop, Implement, and Communicate about 
Workplace Flexibilities and Protections
 Actively encourage sick employees to stay home.
 Ensure that sick leave policies are ˚exible and consistent 
with public health guidance and that employees are aware 
of these policies. 
 Talk with companies that provide your business with 
contract or temporary employees about the importance 
of sick employees staying home and encourage them to 
develop non-punitive leave policies.
 Do not require a healthcare provider™s note for employees 
who are sick with acute respiratory illness to validate their 
illness or to return to work, as healthcare provider of˜ces 
and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able 
to provide such documentation in a timely way.
 Maintain ˚exible policies that permit employees to stay home 
to care for a sick family member. Employers should be aware 
that more employees may need to stay at home to care for 
sick children or other sick family members than is usual.
 Recognize that workers with ill family members may need 
to stay home to care for them. See CDC™s Interim Guidance 
for Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in Homes and 
Residential Communities: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html
. Be aware of workers™ concerns about pay, leave, safety, 
health, and other issues that may arise during infectious 
disease outbreaks. Provide adequate, usable, and 
appropriate training, education, and informational material 
about business-essential job functions and worker health 
and safety, including proper hygiene practices and the 
use of any workplace controls (including PPE). Informed 
workers who feel safe at work are less likely to be 
unnecessarily absent.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION12 Work with insurance companies (e.g., those providing 
employee health bene˜ts) and state and local health 
agencies to provide information to workers and customers 
about medical care in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.
Implement Workplace Controls
Occupational safety and health professionals use a framework 
called the ﬁhierarchy of controlsﬂ to select ways of controlling 
workplace hazards. In other words, the best way to control 
a hazard is to systematically remove it from the workplace, 
rather than relying on workers to reduce their exposure. 
During a COVID-19 outbreak, when it may not be possible to 
eliminate the hazard, the most effective protection measures 
are (listed from most effective to least effective): engineering 
controls, administrative controls, safe work practices (a type 
of administrative control), and PPE. There are advantages 
and disadvantages to each type of control measure when 
considering the ease of implementation, effectiveness, and 
cost. In most cases, a combination of control measures will be 
necessary to protect workers from exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the types of workplace controls discussed below, 
CDC guidance for businesses provides employers and workers 
with recommended SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies 
to implement in workplaces: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/speci˜c-groups/guidance-business-response.html
.Engineering Controls
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-
related hazards. In workplaces where they are appropriate, these 
types of controls reduce exposure to hazards without relying on 
worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to 
implement. Engineering controls for SARS-CoV-2 include:
 Installing high-ef˜ciency air ˜lters.
 Increasing ventilation rates in the work environment.
 Installing physical barriers, such as clear plastic 
sneeze
 guards.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1913 Installing a drive-through window for customer service.
 Specialized negative pressure ventilation in some settings, 
such as for aerosol generating procedures (e.g., airborne 
infection isolation rooms in healthcare settings and 
specialized autopsy suites in mortuary settings).
Administrative Controls
Administrative controls require action by the worker or employer. 
Typically, administrative controls are changes in work policy 
or procedures to reduce or minimize exposure to a hazard. 
Examples of administrative controls for SARS-CoV-2 include:
 Encouraging sick workers to stay at home.
 Minimizing contact among workers, clients, and 
customers by replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual 
communications and implementing telework if feasible. 
 Establishing alternating days or extra shifts that reduce 
the total number of employees in a facility at a given time, 
allowing them to maintain distance from one another while 
maintaining a full onsite work week.
 Discontinuing nonessential travel to locations with ongoing 
COVID-19 outbreaks. Regularly check CDC travel warning 
levels at: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers
. Developing emergency communications plans, including a 
forum for answering workers™ concerns and internet-based 
communications, if feasible.
 Providing workers with up-to-date education and training 
on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors (e.g., 
cough etiquette and care of PPE). 
 Training workers who need to use protecting clothing 
and equipment how to put it on, use/wear it, and take 
it off correctly, including in the context of their current 
and potential duties. Training material should be easy to 
understand and available in the appropriate language and 
literacy level for all workers.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION14Safe Work Practices
Safe work practices are types of administrative controls that 
include procedures for safe and proper work used to reduce 
the duration, frequency, or intensity of exposure to a hazard. 
Examples of safe work practices for SARS-CoV-2 include:
 Providing resources and a work environment that promotes 
personal hygiene. For example, provide tissues, no-touch 
trash cans, hand soap, alcohol-based hand rubs containing 
at least 60 percent alcohol, disinfectants, and disposable 
towels for workers to clean their work surfaces. 
 Requiring regular hand washing or using of alcohol-based 
hand rubs. Workers should always wash hands when they 
are visibly soiled and after removing any PPE.
 Post handwashing signs in restrooms. 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
While engineering and administrative controls are considered 
more effective in minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2, PPE 
may also be needed to prevent certain exposures. While 
correctly using PPE can help prevent some exposures, it 
should not take the place of other prevention strategies. 
Examples of PPE include: gloves, goggles, face shields, face 
masks, and respiratory protection, when appropriate. During 
an outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, 
recommendations for PPE speci˜c to occupations or job tasks 
may change depending on geographic location, updated 
risk assessments for workers, and information on PPE 
effectiveness in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Employers 
should check the 
OSHA
 and 
CDC
 websites regularly for 
updates about recommended PPE.
All types of PPE must be:
 Selected based upon the hazard to the worker.
 Properly ˜tted and periodically re˜tted, as applicable 
(e.g.,
 respirators).
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1915 Consistently and properly worn when required.
 Regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, 
as
 necessary.
 Properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of, 
as
 applicable, to avoid contamination of self, others, or 
the environment.
Employers are obligated to provide their workers with PPE 
needed to keep them safe while performing their jobs. The 
types of PPE required during a COVID-19 outbreak will be 
based on the risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 while 
working and job tasks that may lead to exposure.
Workers, including those who work within 6 feet of patients 
known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2 
and those performing aerosol-generating procedures, need to 
use respirators: 
 National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH)-approved, N95 ˜ltering facepiece 
respirators or better must be used in the context of a 
comprehensive, written respiratory protection program 
that includes ˜t-testing, training, and medical exams. 
See OSHA™s Respiratory Protection standard, 29 CFR 
1910.134 at 
www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/
standardnumber/1910/1910.134
. When disposable N95 ˜ltering facepiece respirators are 
not available, consider using other respirators that provide 
greater protection and improve worker comfort. Other 
types of acceptable respirators include: a R/P95, N/R/P99, 
or N/R/P100 ˜ltering facepiece respirator; an air-purifying 
elastomeric (e.g., half-face or full-face) respirator with 
appropriate ˜lters or cartridges; powered air purifying 
respirator (PAPR) with high-ef˜ciency particulate arrestance 
(HEPA) ˜lter; or supplied air respirator (SAR). See CDC/
NIOSH guidance for optimizing respirator supplies at: 
www.
 cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy
. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION16 Consider using PAPRs or SARs, which are more protective 
than ˜ltering facepiece respirators, for any work operations 
or procedures likely to generate aerosols (e.g., cough 
induction procedures, some dental procedures, invasive 
specimen collection, blowing out pipettes, shaking or 
vortexing tubes, ˜lling a syringe, centrifugation). 
 Use a surgical N95 respirator when both respiratory 
protection and resistance to blood and body ˚uids is needed. 
 Face shields may also be worn on top of a respirator to 
prevent bulk contamination of the respirator. Certain 
respirator designs with forward protrusions (duckbill 
style) may be dif˜cult to properly wear under a face shield. 
Ensure that the face shield does not prevent air˚ow through 
the respirator.
 Consider factors such as function, ˜t, ability to 
decontaminate, disposal, and cost. OSHA™s Respiratory 
Protection eTool provides basic information on respirators 
such as medical requirements, maintenance and care, 
˜t testing, written respiratory protection programs, and 
voluntary use of respirators, which employers may also 
˜nd bene˜cial in training workers at: 
www.osha.gov/SLTC/
etools/respiratory
. Also see NIOSH respirator guidance at: 
www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators
. Respirator training should address selection, use (including 
donning and dof˜ng), proper disposal or disinfection, 
inspection for damage, maintenance, and the limitations 
of respiratory protection equipment. Learn more at: 
www.
osha.gov/SLTC/respiratoryprotection
. The appropriate form of respirator will depend on the 
type of exposure and on the transmission pattern of 
COVID-19. See the NIOSH ﬁRespirator Selection Logicﬂ

.GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1917Follow Existing OSHA Standards
Existing OSHA standards may apply to protecting workers 
from exposure to and infection with SARS-CoV-2.
While there is no speci˜c OSHA standard covering SARS-
CoV-2 exposure, some OSHA requirements may apply to 
preventing occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Among the 
most relevant are:
 OSHA™s Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) standards 
(in general industry,
 29 CFR 1910 Subpart I), which require 
using gloves, eye and face protection, and respiratory 
protection. See: 
www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/
standardnumber/1910#1910_Subpart_I
.  When respirators are necessary to protect workers or 
where employers require respirator use, employers 
must implement a comprehensive respiratory protection 
program in accordance with the Respiratory Protection 
standard (29 CFR 1910.134). See: 
www.osha.gov/laws-
regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134
.  The General Duty Clause,
 Section 5(a)(1)
 of 
the
 Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970, 
29 USC 654(a)(1), which requires employers to furnish to 
each worker ﬁemployment and a place of employment, 
which are free from recognized hazards that are causing 
or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ 
See:
 www.
 osha.
 gov/laws-regs/oshact/completeoshact
. OSHA™s Bloodborne Pathogens standard (
29 CFR 1910.1030
) applies to occupational exposure to human blood and other 
potentially infectious materials that typically do not include 
respiratory secretions that may transmit SARS-CoV-2. 
However, the provisions of the standard offer a framework 
that may help control some sources of the virus, including 
exposures to
 body ˚uids
 (e.g., respiratory secretions) not 
covered by the standard. See: 
www.osha.gov/laws-regs/
regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030
. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION18The OSHA COVID-19 webpage provides additional information 
about OSHA standards and requirements, including 
requirements in states that operate their own OSHA-approved 
State Plans, recordkeeping requirements and injury/illness 
recording criteria, and applications of standards related to 
sanitation and communication of risks related to hazardous 
chemicals that may be in common sanitizers and sterilizers. 
See: 
www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html
.Classifying Worker Exposure to 
SARS
-CoV-2
Worker risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the 
virus that causes COVID-19, during an outbreak may vary from 
very high to high, medium, or lower (caution) risk. The level 
of risk depends in part on the industry type, need for contact 
within 6 feet of people known to be, or suspected of being, 
infected with SARS-CoV-2, or requirement for repeated or 
extended contact with persons known to be, or suspected of 
being, infected with SARS-CoV-2. To help employers determine 
appropriate precautions, OSHA has divided job tasks into 
four risk exposure levels: very high, high, medium, and lower 
risk. The Occupational Risk Pyramid shows the four exposure 
risk levels in the shape of a pyramid to represent probable 
distribution of risk. Most American workers will likely fall in the 
lower exposure risk (caution) or medium exposure risk levels.
Occupational Risk Pyramid 
 for COVID-19
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1919Very High Exposure Risk
Very high exposure risk
 jobs are those with high potential for 
exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID-19 during 
speci˜c medical, postmortem, or laboratory procedures. 
Workers in this category include:
 Healthcare workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, dentists, 
paramedics, emergency medical technicians) performing 
aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation, cough 
induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental 
procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection) on 
known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
 Healthcare or laboratory personnel collecting or handling 
specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients 
(e.g., manipulating cultures from known or suspected 
COVID-19 patients).
 Morgue workers performing autopsies, which generally 
involve aerosol-generating procedures, on the bodies of 
people who are known to have, or suspected of having, 
COVID-19 at the time of their death.
High Exposure Risk
High exposure risk
 jobs are those with high potential for 
exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID-19. Workers 
in this category include:
 Healthcare delivery and support staff (e.g., doctors, 
nurses, and other hospital staff who must enter patients™ 
rooms) exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients. 
(Note: when such workers perform aerosol-generating 
procedures, their exposure risk level becomes 
very high.
) Medical transport workers (e.g., ambulance vehicle 
operators) moving known or suspected COVID-19 patients 
in enclosed vehicles.
 Mortuary workers involved in preparing (e.g., for burial or 
cremation) the bodies of people who are known to have, or 
suspected of having, COVID-19 at the time of their death.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION20Medium Exposure Risk
Medium exposure risk
 jobs include those that require frequent 
and/or close contact with (i.e., within 6 feet of) people who 
may be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but who are not known 
or suspected COVID-19 patients. In areas without ongoing 
community transmission, workers in this risk group may 
have frequent contact with travelers who may return from 
international locations with widespread COVID-19 transmission. 
In areas where there 
is ongoing community transmission, 
workers in this category may have contact be with the 
general public (e.g., in schools, high-population-density work 
environments, and some high-volume retail settings).
Lower Exposure Risk (Caution)
Lower exposure risk (caution)
 jobs are those that do not 
require
 contact with people known to be, or suspected of 
being, infected with SARS-CoV-2 nor frequent close contact 
with (i.e., within 6
 feet of) the general public. Workers in this 
category have minimal occupational contact with the public 
and other coworkers.
Jobs Classi˜ed at Lower Exposure 
Risk (Caution): What to Do to 
Protect
 Workers
For workers who do not have frequent contact with the general 
public, employers should follow the guidance for ﬁ
Steps All 
Employers Can Take to Reduce
 Workers™ Risk of Exposure 
to
 SARS-CoV-2
,ﬂ on page 7 of this booklet and implement 
control measures described in this section.
Engineering Controls
Additional engineering controls are not recommended for 
workers in the lower exposure risk group. Employers should 
ensure that engineering controls, if any, used to protect workers 
from other job hazards continue to function as intended. 
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1921Administrative Controls
 Monitor public health communications about COVID-19 
recommendations and ensure that workers have access 
to that information. Frequently check the CDC COVID-19 
website: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov
. Collaborate with workers to designate effective means of 
communicating important COVID-19 information.
Personal Protective Equipment
Additional PPE is not recommended for workers in the lower 
exposure risk group. Workers should continue to use the PPE, 
if
 any, that they would ordinarily use for other job tasks.
Jobs Classi˜ed at Medium Exposure 
Risk: What to Do to Protect Workers
In workplaces where workers have medium exposure risk, 
employers should follow the guidance for ﬁ
Steps All Employers 
Can Take to Reduce
 Workers™ Risk of Exposure to
 SARS-CoV-2
,ﬂ 
on page 7 of this booklet and implement control measures 
described in this section.
 Engineering Controls
 Install physical barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards, 
where feasible.
Administrative Controls
 Consider offering face masks to ill employees and customers 
to contain respiratory secretions until they are able leave 
the workplace (i.e., for medical evaluation/care or to return 
home). In the event of a shortage of masks, a reusable face 
shield that can be decontaminated may be an acceptable 
method of protecting against droplet transmission. See CDC/
NIOSH guidance for optimizing respirator supplies, which 
discusses the use of surgical masks, at: 
www.cdc.gov/
coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy
.OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION22 Keep customers informed about symptoms of COVID-19 and 
ask sick customers to minimize contact with workers until 
healthy again, such as by posting signs about COVID-19 in 
stores where sick customers may visit (e.g., pharmacies) or 
including COVID-19 information in automated messages sent 
when prescriptions are ready for pick up.
 Where appropriate, limit customers™ and the public™s access to 
the worksite, or restrict access to only certain workplace areas.
 Consider strategies to minimize face-to-face contact (e.g., drive-
through windows, phone-based communication, telework). 
 Communicate the availability of medical screening or other 
worker health resources (e.g., on-site nurse; telemedicine 
services).
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
When selecting PPE, consider factors such as function, ˜t, 
decontamination ability, disposal, and cost. Sometimes, when 
PPE will have to be used repeatedly for a long period of time, a 
more expensive and durable type of PPE may be less expensive 
overall than disposable PPE. 
Each employer should select 
the combination of PPE that 
protects workers speci˜c to 
their workplace.
Workers with medium 
exposure risk may need to 
wear some combination 
of gloves, a gown, a face 
mask, and/or a face shield 
or goggles. PPE ensembles 
for workers in the medium 
exposure risk category will 
vary by work task, the results 
of the employer™s hazard 
assessment, and the types of 
exposures workers have on 
the job.
High exposure risk jobs 
are those with high 
potential for exposure 
to known or suspected 
sources of COVID-19.
Very high exposure risk
 jobs are those with high 
potential for exposure 
to known or suspected 
sources of COVID-19 
during speci˜c medical, 
postmortem, or laboratory 
procedures that involve 
aerosol generation or 
specimen collection/
handling.

more recommendations on air handling systems at: 
www.
cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5210a1.htm
. CDC recommends that patients with known or suspected 
COVID-19 (i.e., person under investigation) should be placed 
in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), if available.
 Use isolation rooms when available for performing 
aerosol-generating procedures on patients with known 
or suspected COVID-19. For postmortem activities, use 
autopsy suites or other similar isolation facilities when 
performing aerosol-generating procedures on the bodies 
of people who are known to have, or suspected of 
having, COVID-19 at the time of their death. See the CDC 
postmortem guidance at:

.Administrative Controls
If working in a healthcare facility, follow existing guidelines 
and facility standards of practice for identifying and isolating 
infected individuals and for protecting workers. 
 Develop and implement policies that reduce exposure, such 
as cohorting (i.e., grouping) COVID-19 patients when single 
rooms are not available. 
 Post signs requesting patients and family members to 
immediately report symptoms of respiratory illness on 
arrival at the healthcare facility and use disposable face 
masks.
 Consider offering enhanced medical monitoring of workers 
during COVID-19 outbreaks.
 Provide all workers with job-speci˜c education and training 
on preventing transmission of COVID-19, including initial 
and routine/refresher training.
 Ensure that psychological and behavioral support is 
available to address employee stress.
Safe Work Practices
 Provide emergency responders and other essential 
personnel who may be exposed while working away from 
˜xed facilities with alcohol-based hand rubs containing at 
least 60% alcohol for decontamination in the ˜eld. 
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1925Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Most workers at high or very high exposure risk likely need 
to wear gloves, a gown, a face shield or goggles, and either 
a face mask or a respirator, depending on their job tasks and 
exposure risks. 
Those who work closely with (either in contact with or within 
6 feet of) patients known to be, or suspected of being, infected 
with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, should wear 
respirators. In these instances, see the PPE section beginning 
on 
page 
14 of this booklet, which provides more details 
about respirators. For the most up-to-date information, also 
visit OSHA™s COVID-19 webpage: 
www.osha.gov/covid-19
. PPE ensembles may vary, especially for workers in laboratories 
or morgue/mortuary facilities who may need additional 
protection against blood, body ˚uids, chemicals, and other 
materials to which they may be exposed. Additional PPE may 
include medical/surgical gowns, ˚uid-resistant coveralls, 
aprons, or other disposable or reusable protective clothing. 
Gowns should be large enough to cover the areas requiring 
protection. OSHA may also provide updated guidance for PPE 
use on its website: 
www.osha.gov/covid-19
.NOTE: 
Workers who dispose of PPE and other infectious waste 
must also be trained and provided with appropriate PPE.

Employers should communicate to workers that the DOS cannot 
provide Americans traveling or living abroad with medications 
or supplies, even in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.
As COVID-19 outbreak conditions change, travel into or out of 
a country may not be possible, safe, or medically advisable. 
It is also likely that governments will respond to a COVID-19 
outbreak by imposing public health measures that restrict 
domestic and international movement, further limiting the U.S. 
government™s ability to assist Americans in these countries. It 
is important that employers and workers plan appropriately, 
as it is possible that these measures will be implemented 
very quickly in the event of worsening outbreak conditions in 
certain areas.

 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease 
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has spread from China to 
many other countries around the world, including the United 
States. Depending on the severity of COVID-19™s international 
impacts, outbreak conditionsŠincluding those rising to the level 
of a pandemicŠcan affect all aspects of daily life, including 
travel, trade, tourism, food supplies, and ˜nancial markets.
To reduce the impact of COVID-19 outbreak conditions on 
businesses, workers, customers, and the public, it is important 
for all employers to plan now for COVID-19. For employers who 
have already planned for in˚uenza pandemics, planning for 
COVID-19 may involve updating plans to address the speci˜c 
exposure risks, sources of exposure, routes of transmission, 
and other unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., compared 
to pandemic in˚uenza viruses). Employers who have not 
prepared for pandemic events should prepare themselves 
and their workers as far in advance as possible of potentially 
worsening outbreak conditions. Lack of continuity planning can 
result in a cascade of failures as employers attempt to address 
challenges of COVID-19 with insuf˜cient resources and workers 
who might not be adequately trained for jobs they may have to 
perform under pandemic conditions.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
developed this COVID-19 planning guidance based on traditional 
infection prevention and industrial hygiene practices. It focuses on 
the need for employers to implement engineering, administrative, 
and work practice controls and personal protective equipment 
(PPE), as well as considerations for doing so.
This guidance is intended for planning purposes. Employers 
and workers should use this planning guidance to help 
identify risk levels in workplace settings and to determine 
any appropriate control measures to implement. Additional 
guidance may be needed as COVID-19 outbreak conditions 
change, including as new information about the virus, its 
transmission, and impacts, becomes available.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION4The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services™ Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides the 
latest information about COVID-19 and the global outbreak: 
www.
 cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov
.The OSHA COVID-19 webpage offers information speci˜cally 
for workers and employers: 
www.osha.gov/covid-19
.This guidance is advisory in nature and informational in 
content. It is not a standard or a regulation, and it neither 
creates new legal obligations nor alters existing obligations 
created by OSHA standards or the 
Occupational Safety and 
Health Act
 (OSH Act). Pursuant to the OSH Act, employers 
must comply with safety and health standards and regulations 
issued and enforced either by OSHA or by an OSHA-approved 
State Plan. In addition, the OSH Act™s General Duty Clause, 
Section 5(a)(1)
, requires employers to provide their employees 
with a workplace free from recognized hazards likely to cause 
death or serious physical harm. OSHA-approved State Plans 
may have standards, regulations and enforcement policies that 
are different from, but at least as effective as, OSHA™s. Check 
with your 
State Plan

About COVID-19
Symptoms of COVID-19
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can 
cause illness ranging from mild to severe and, in some cases, 
can be fatal. Symptoms typically include fever, cough, and 
shortness of breath. Some people infected with the virus have 
reported experiencing other non-respiratory symptoms. Other 
people, referred to as 
asymptomatic cases
, have experienced 
no symptoms at all.
According to the CDC, symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in 
as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-195How COVID-19 Spreads
Although the ˜rst human cases of COVID-19 likely resulted 
from exposure to infected animals, infected people can spread 
SARS-CoV-2 to other people.
The virus is thought to 
spread mainly from person-
to-person, including:
 Between people who 
are
 in close contact 
with
 one another (within 
about 6 feet).
 Through respiratory 
droplets produced when an infected person coughs or 
sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of 
people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching 
a surface or object that has SARS-CoV-2 on it and then 
touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this 
is not thought to be the primary way the virus spreads.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are most 
symptomatic (i.e., experiencing fever, cough, and/or shortness 
of breath). Some spread might be possible before people 
show symptoms; there have been reports of this type of 
asymptomatic transmission with this new coronavirus, but this 
is also not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Although the United States has implemented public health 
measures to limit the spread of the virus, it is likely that some 
person-to-person transmission will continue to occur. 
The CDC website provides the latest information about 
COVID-19 transmission: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
about/transmission.html
.Medium exposure risk
 jobs
 include those that 
require frequent and/or 
close contact with (i.e., 
within 6 feet of) other people 
who may
 be
 infected
 with 
SARS
-CoV-2.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION6How a COVID-19 Outbreak Could 
Affect
 Workplaces
Similar to in˚uenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes 
COVID-19, has the potential to cause extensive outbreaks. 

Under conditions associated with widespread person-to-

person spread, multiple areas of the United States and other 

countries may see impacts at the same time. In the absence 

of a vaccine, an outbreak may also be an extended event. As a 

result, workplaces may experience: 
 Absenteeism
. Workers could be absent because they are 
sick; are caregivers for sick family members; are caregivers 

for children if schools or day care centers are closed; have 

at-risk people at home, such as immunocompromised 

family members; or are afraid to come to work because of 

fear of possible exposure. 
 Change in patterns of commerce
. Consumer demand for 
items related to infection prevention (e.g., respirators) is 

likely to increase signi˜cantly, while consumer interest in 
other goods may decline. Consumers may also change 
shopping patterns because of a COVID-19 outbreak. 

Consumers may try to shop at off-peak hours to reduce 

contact with other people, show increased interest in home 

delivery services, or prefer other options, such as drive-

through service, to reduce person-to-person contact. 
 Interrupted supply/delivery
. Shipments of items from 
geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be 

delayed or cancelled with or without noti˜cation.

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reveals

GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-197Steps All Employers Can Take to 
Reduce
 Workers™ Risk of Exposure 
to
 SARS-CoV-2
This section describes basic steps that every employer can 
take to reduce the risk of worker exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the 
virus that causes COVID-19, in their workplace. Later sections 
of this guidanceŠincluding those focusing on jobs classi˜ed 
as having low, medium, high, and very high exposure risksŠ
provide speci˜c recommendations for employers and workers 
within speci˜c risk categories.
Develop an Infectious Disease Preparedness 
and Response Plan
If one does not already exist, develop an infectious disease 
preparedness and response plan that can help guide protective 
actions against COVID-19.
Stay abreast of guidance from federal, state, local, tribal, and/or 
territorial health agencies, and consider how to incorporate those 
recommendations and resources into workplace-speci˜c plans.
Plans should consider and address the level(s) of risk 
associated with various worksites and job tasks workers 
perform at those sites. Such considerations may include:
 Where, how, and to what sources of SARS-CoV-2 might 
workers be exposed, including:
 The general public, customers, and coworkers; and
 Sick individuals or those at particularly high risk 
of infection (e.g., international travelers who have 
visited locations with widespread sustained (ongoing) 
COVID-19 transmission, healthcare workers who have 
had unprotected exposures to people known to have, or 
suspected of having, COVID-19).
 Non-occupational risk factors at home and in community 
settings.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION8 Workers™ individual risk factors (e.g., older age; 
presence of chronic medical conditions, including 
immunocompromising conditions; pregnancy).
 Controls necessary to address those risks.
Follow federal and state, local, tribal, and/or territorial (SLTT) 
recommendations regarding development of contingency 
plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks, 
such as:
 Increased rates of worker absenteeism.
 The need for social distancing, staggered work shifts, 
downsizing operations, delivering services remotely, and 
other exposure-reducing measures.
 Options for conducting essential operations with a reduced 
workforce, including cross-training workers across different 
jobs in order to continue operations or deliver surge services.
 Interrupted supply chains or delayed deliveries.
Plans should also consider and address the other steps that 
employers can take to reduce the risk of worker exposure to 
SARS-CoV-2 in their workplace, described in the sections below.
Prepare to Implement Basic Infection 
Prevention Measures
For most employers, protecting workers will depend on 
emphasizing basic infection prevention measures. As 
appropriate, all employers should implement good hygiene 
and infection control practices, including: 
 Promote frequent and thorough 
hand washing
, including 
by providing workers, customers, and worksite visitors with 
a place to wash their hands. If soap and running water are 
not immediately available, provide alcohol-based hand rubs 
containing at least 60% alcohol.
 Encourage workers to 
stay home if they are sick
.  Encourage 
respiratory etiquette
, including covering coughs 
and sneezes.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-199 Provide customers and the public with tissues and trash 
receptacles.
 Employers should explore whether they can establish 
policies and practices
, such as ˚exible worksites (e.g., 
telecommuting) and ˚exible work hours (e.g., staggered 
shifts), to increase the physical distance among 
employees and between employees and others if state 
and local health authorities recommend the use of social 
distancing strategies. 
 Discourage workers from using other workers™ phones, desks, 
of˜ces, or other work tools and equipment, when possible.
 Maintain regular housekeeping practices, including routine 
cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, equipment, and 
other elements of the work environment. When choosing 
cleaning chemicals, employers should consult information 
on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved 
disinfectant labels with claims against emerging viral 
pathogens. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral 
pathogens claims are expected
 to be effective against 
SARS-CoV-2 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow 
the manufacturer™s instructions for use of all cleaning and 
disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application 
method and contact time, PPE). 
Develop Policies and Procedures for Prompt 
Identi˜cation and Isolation of Sick People, 
if
 Appropriate
 Prompt identi˜cation and isolation of potentially infectious 
individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, 
customers, visitors, and others at a worksite.
 Employers should inform and encourage employees to 
self-monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 if they 
suspect possible exposure. 
 Employers should develop policies and procedures for 
employees to report when they are sick or experiencing 
symptoms of COVID-19. 
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION10 Where appropriate, employers should develop policies 
and procedures for immediately isolating people who have 
signs and/or symptoms
 of COVID-19, and train workers to 
implement them. Move potentially infectious people to a 
location away from workers, customers, and other visitors. 
Although most worksites do not have speci˜c isolation 
rooms, designated areas with closable doors may serve as 
isolation rooms until potentially sick people can be removed 
from the worksite. 
 Take steps to limit spread of the respiratory secretions of 
a person who may have COVID-19. Provide a face mask, 
if feasible and available, and ask the person to wear it, if 
tolerated. Note: A face mask (also called a surgical mask, 
procedure mask, or other similar terms) on a patient or 
other sick person should not be confused with PPE for 
a worker; the mask acts to contain potentially infectious 
respiratory secretions at the source (i.e., the person™s nose 
and mouth).
 If possible, isolate people suspected of having COVID-19 
separately from those with con˜rmed cases of the virus 
to prevent further transmissionŠparticularly in worksites 
where medical screening, triage, or healthcare activities 
occur, using either permanent (e.g., wall/different room) or 
temporary barrier (e.g., plastic sheeting).
 Restrict the number of personnel entering isolation areas.
 Protect workers in close contact with (i.e., within 6 feet of) 
a sick person or who have prolonged/repeated contact 
with such persons by using additional engineering and 
administrative controls, safe work practices, and PPE. 
Workers whose activities involve close or prolonged/
repeated contact with sick people are addressed further in 
later sections covering workplaces classi˜ed at medium and 
very high or high exposure risk.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1911Develop, Implement, and Communicate about 
Workplace Flexibilities and Protections
 Actively encourage sick employees to stay home.
 Ensure that sick leave policies are ˚exible and consistent 
with public health guidance and that employees are aware 
of these policies. 
 Talk with companies that provide your business with 
contract or temporary employees about the importance 
of sick employees staying home and encourage them to 
develop non-punitive leave policies.
 Do not require a healthcare provider™s note for employees 
who are sick with acute respiratory illness to validate their 
illness or to return to work, as healthcare provider of˜ces 
and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able 
to provide such documentation in a timely way.
 Maintain ˚exible policies that permit employees to stay home 
to care for a sick family member. Employers should be aware 
that more employees may need to stay at home to care for 
sick children or other sick family members than is usual.
 Recognize that workers with ill family members may need 
to stay home to care for them. See CDC™s Interim Guidance 
for Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in Homes and 
Residential Communities: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html
. Be aware of workers™ concerns about pay, leave, safety, 
health, and other issues that may arise during infectious 
disease outbreaks. Provide adequate, usable, and 
appropriate training, education, and informational material 
about business-essential job functions and worker health 
and safety, including proper hygiene practices and the 
use of any workplace controls (including PPE). Informed 
workers who feel safe at work are less likely to be 
unnecessarily absent.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION12 Work with insurance companies (e.g., those providing 
employee health bene˜ts) and state and local health 
agencies to provide information to workers and customers 
about medical care in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.
Implement Workplace Controls
Occupational safety and health professionals use a framework 
called the ﬁhierarchy of controlsﬂ to select ways of controlling 
workplace hazards. In other words, the best way to control 
a hazard is to systematically remove it from the workplace, 
rather than relying on workers to reduce their exposure. 
During a COVID-19 outbreak, when it may not be possible to 
eliminate the hazard, the most effective protection measures 
are (listed from most effective to least effective): engineering 
controls, administrative controls, safe work practices (a type 
of administrative control), and PPE. There are advantages 
and disadvantages to each type of control measure when 
considering the ease of implementation, effectiveness, and 
cost. In most cases, a combination of control measures will be 
necessary to protect workers from exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the types of workplace controls discussed below, 
CDC guidance for businesses provides employers and workers 
with recommended SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies 
to implement in workplaces: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/speci˜c-groups/guidance-business-response.html
.Engineering Controls
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-
related hazards. In workplaces where they are appropriate, these 
types of controls reduce exposure to hazards without relying on 
worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to 
implement. Engineering controls for SARS-CoV-2 include:
 Installing high-ef˜ciency air ˜lters.
 Increasing ventilation rates in the work environment.
 Installing physical barriers, such as clear plastic 
sneeze
 guards.
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1913 Installing a drive-through window for customer service.
 Specialized negative pressure ventilation in some settings, 
such as for aerosol generating procedures (e.g., airborne 
infection isolation rooms in healthcare settings and 
specialized autopsy suites in mortuary settings).
Administrative Controls
Administrative controls require action by the worker or employer. 
Typically, administrative controls are changes in work policy 
or procedures to reduce or minimize exposure to a hazard. 
Examples of administrative controls for SARS-CoV-2 include:
 Encouraging sick workers to stay at home.
 Minimizing contact among workers, clients, and 
customers by replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual 
communications and implementing telework if feasible. 
 Establishing alternating days or extra shifts that reduce 
the total number of employees in a facility at a given time, 
allowing them to maintain distance from one another while 
maintaining a full onsite work week.
 Discontinuing nonessential travel to locations with ongoing 
COVID-19 outbreaks. Regularly check CDC travel warning 
levels at: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers
. Developing emergency communications plans, including a 
forum for answering workers™ concerns and internet-based 
communications, if feasible.
 Providing workers with up-to-date education and training 
on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors (e.g., 
cough etiquette and care of PPE). 
 Training workers who need to use protecting clothing 
and equipment how to put it on, use/wear it, and take 
it off correctly, including in the context of their current 
and potential duties. Training material should be easy to 
understand and available in the appropriate language and 
literacy level for all workers.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION14Safe Work Practices
Safe work practices are types of administrative controls that 
include procedures for safe and proper work used to reduce 
the duration, frequency, or intensity of exposure to a hazard. 
Examples of safe work practices for SARS-CoV-2 include:
 Providing resources and a work environment that promotes 
personal hygiene. For example, provide tissues, no-touch 
trash cans, hand soap, alcohol-based hand rubs containing 
at least 60 percent alcohol, disinfectants, and disposable 
towels for workers to clean their work surfaces. 
 Requiring regular hand washing or using of alcohol-based 
hand rubs. Workers should always wash hands when they 
are visibly soiled and after removing any PPE.
 Post handwashing signs in restrooms. 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
While engineering and administrative controls are considered 
more effective in minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2, PPE 
may also be needed to prevent certain exposures. While 
correctly using PPE can help prevent some exposures, it 
should not take the place of other prevention strategies. 
Examples of PPE include: gloves, goggles, face shields, face 
masks, and respiratory protection, when appropriate. During 
an outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, 
recommendations for PPE speci˜c to occupations or job tasks 
may change depending on geographic location, updated 
risk assessments for workers, and information on PPE 
effectiveness in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Employers 
should check the 
OSHA
 and 
CDC
 websites regularly for 
updates about recommended PPE.
All types of PPE must be:
 Selected based upon the hazard to the worker.
 Properly ˜tted and periodically re˜tted, as applicable 
(e.g.,
 respirators).
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1915 Consistently and properly worn when required.
 Regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, 
as
 necessary.
 Properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of, 
as
 applicable, to avoid contamination of self, others, or 
the environment.
Employers are obligated to provide their workers with PPE 
needed to keep them safe while performing their jobs. The 
types of PPE required during a COVID-19 outbreak will be 
based on the risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 while 
working and job tasks that may lead to exposure.
Workers, including those who work within 6 feet of patients 
known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2 
and those performing aerosol-generating procedures, need to 
use respirators: 
 National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH)-approved, N95 ˜ltering facepiece 
respirators or better must be used in the context of a 
comprehensive, written respiratory protection program 
that includes ˜t-testing, training, and medical exams. 
See OSHA™s Respiratory Protection standard, 29 CFR 
1910.134 at 
www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/
standardnumber/1910/1910.134
. When disposable N95 ˜ltering facepiece respirators are 
not available, consider using other respirators that provide 
greater protection and improve worker comfort. Other 
types of acceptable respirators include: a R/P95, N/R/P99, 
or N/R/P100 ˜ltering facepiece respirator; an air-purifying 
elastomeric (e.g., half-face or full-face) respirator with 
appropriate ˜lters or cartridges; powered air purifying 
respirator (PAPR) with high-ef˜ciency particulate arrestance 
(HEPA) ˜lter; or supplied air respirator (SAR). See CDC/
NIOSH guidance for optimizing respirator supplies at: 
www.
 cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy
. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION16 Consider using PAPRs or SARs, which are more protective 
than ˜ltering facepiece respirators, for any work operations 
or procedures likely to generate aerosols (e.g., cough 
induction procedures, some dental procedures, invasive 
specimen collection, blowing out pipettes, shaking or 
vortexing tubes, ˜lling a syringe, centrifugation). 
 Use a surgical N95 respirator when both respiratory 
protection and resistance to blood and body ˚uids is needed. 
 Face shields may also be worn on top of a respirator to 
prevent bulk contamination of the respirator. Certain 
respirator designs with forward protrusions (duckbill 
style) may be dif˜cult to properly wear under a face shield. 
Ensure that the face shield does not prevent air˚ow through 
the respirator.
 Consider factors such as function, ˜t, ability to 
decontaminate, disposal, and cost. OSHA™s Respiratory 
Protection eTool provides basic information on respirators 
such as medical requirements, maintenance and care, 
˜t testing, written respiratory protection programs, and 
voluntary use of respirators, which employers may also 
˜nd bene˜cial in training workers at: 
www.osha.gov/SLTC/
etools/respiratory
. Also see NIOSH respirator guidance at: 
www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators
. Respirator training should address selection, use (including 
donning and dof˜ng), proper disposal or disinfection, 
inspection for damage, maintenance, and the limitations 
of respiratory protection equipment. Learn more at: 
www.
osha.gov/SLTC/respiratoryprotection
. The appropriate form of respirator will depend on the 
type of exposure and on the transmission pattern of 
COVID-19. See the NIOSH ﬁRespirator Selection Logicﬂ

.GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1917Follow Existing OSHA Standards
Existing OSHA standards may apply to protecting workers 
from exposure to and infection with SARS-CoV-2.
While there is no speci˜c OSHA standard covering SARS-
CoV-2 exposure, some OSHA requirements may apply to 
preventing occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Among the 
most relevant are:
 OSHA™s Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) standards 
(in general industry,
 29 CFR 1910 Subpart I), which require 
using gloves, eye and face protection, and respiratory 
protection. See: 
www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/
standardnumber/1910#1910_Subpart_I
.  When respirators are necessary to protect workers or 
where employers require respirator use, employers 
must implement a comprehensive respiratory protection 
program in accordance with the Respiratory Protection 
standard (29 CFR 1910.134). See: 
www.osha.gov/laws-
regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134
.  The General Duty Clause,
 Section 5(a)(1)
 of 
the
 Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970, 
29 USC 654(a)(1), which requires employers to furnish to 
each worker ﬁemployment and a place of employment, 
which are free from recognized hazards that are causing 
or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ 
See:
 www.
 osha.
 gov/laws-regs/oshact/completeoshact
. OSHA™s Bloodborne Pathogens standard (
29 CFR 1910.1030
) applies to occupational exposure to human blood and other 
potentially infectious materials that typically do not include 
respiratory secretions that may transmit SARS-CoV-2. 
However, the provisions of the standard offer a framework 
that may help control some sources of the virus, including 
exposures to
 body ˚uids
 (e.g., respiratory secretions) not 
covered by the standard. See: 
www.osha.gov/laws-regs/
regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030

-CoV-2
Worker risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the 
virus that causes COVID-19, during an outbreak may vary from 
very high to high, medium, or lower (caution) risk. The level 
of risk depends in part on the industry type, need for contact 
within 6 feet of people known to be, or suspected of being, 
infected with SARS-CoV-2, or requirement for repeated or 
extended contact with persons known to be, or suspected of 
being, infected with SARS-CoV-2. To help employers determine 
appropriate precautions, OSHA has divided job tasks into 
four risk exposure levels: very high, high, medium, and lower 
risk. The Occupational Risk Pyramid shows the four exposure 
risk levels in the shape of a pyramid to represent probable 
distribution of risk. Most American workers will likely fall in the 
lower exposure risk (caution) or medium exposure risk levels.
Occupational Risk Pyramid 
 for COVID-19
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1919Very High Exposure Risk
Very high exposure risk
 jobs are those with high potential for 
exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID-19 during 
speci˜c medical, postmortem, or laboratory procedures. 
Workers in this category include:
 Healthcare workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, dentists, 
paramedics, emergency medical technicians) performing 
aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation, cough 
induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental 
procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection) on 
known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
 Healthcare or laboratory personnel collecting or handling 
specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients 
(e.g., manipulating cultures from known or suspected 
COVID-19 patients).
 Morgue workers performing autopsies, which generally 
involve aerosol-generating procedures, on the bodies of 
people who are known to have, or suspected of having, 
COVID-19 at the time of their death.
High Exposure Risk
High exposure risk
 jobs are those with high potential for 
exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID-19. Workers 
in this category include:
 Healthcare delivery and support staff (e.g., doctors, 
nurses, and other hospital staff who must enter patients™ 
rooms) exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients. 
(Note: when such workers perform aerosol-generating 
procedures, their exposure risk level becomes 
very high.
) Medical transport workers (e.g., ambulance vehicle 
operators) moving known or suspected COVID-19 patients 
in enclosed vehicles.
 Mortuary workers involved in preparing (e.g., for burial or 
cremation) the bodies of people who are known to have, or 
suspected of having, COVID-19 at the time of their death.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION20Medium Exposure Risk
Medium exposure risk
 jobs include those that require frequent 
and/or close contact with (i.e., within 6 feet of) people who 
may be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but who are not known 
or suspected COVID-19 patients. In areas without ongoing 
community transmission, workers in this risk group may 
have frequent contact with travelers who may return from 
international locations with widespread COVID-19 transmission. 
In areas where there 
is ongoing community transmission, 
workers in this category may have contact be with the 
general public (e.g., in schools, high-population-density work 
environments, and some high-volume retail settings).
Lower Exposure Risk (Caution)
Lower exposure risk (caution)
 jobs are those that do not 
require
 contact with people known to be, or suspected of 
being, infected with SARS-CoV-2 nor frequent close contact 
with (i.e., within 6
 feet of) the general public. Workers in this 
category have minimal occupational contact with the public 
and other coworkers.
Jobs Classi˜ed at Lower Exposure 
Risk (Caution): What to Do to 
Protect
 Workers
For workers who do not have frequent contact with the general 
public, employers should follow the guidance for ﬁ
Steps All 
Employers Can Take to Reduce
 Workers™ Risk of Exposure 
to
 SARS-CoV-2
,ﬂ on page 7 of this booklet and implement 
control measures described in this section.
Engineering Controls
Additional engineering controls are not recommended for 
workers in the lower exposure risk group. Employers should 
ensure that engineering controls, if any, used to protect workers 
from other job hazards continue to function as intended. 
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1921Administrative Controls
 Monitor public health communications about COVID-19 
recommendations and ensure that workers have access 
to that information. Frequently check the CDC COVID-19 
website: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov
. Collaborate with workers to designate effective means of 
communicating important COVID-19 information.
Personal Protective Equipment
Additional PPE is not recommended for workers in the lower 
exposure risk group. Workers should continue to use the PPE, 
if
 any, that they would ordinarily use for other job tasks.
Jobs Classi˜ed at Medium Exposure 
Risk: What to Do to Protect Workers
In workplaces where workers have medium exposure risk, 
employers should follow the guidance for ﬁ
Steps All Employers 
Can Take to Reduce
 Workers™ Risk of Exposure to
 SARS-CoV-2
,ﬂ 
on page 7 of this booklet and implement control measures 
described in this section.
 Engineering Controls
 Install physical barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards, 
where feasible.
Administrative Controls
 Consider offering face masks to ill employees and customers 
to contain respiratory secretions until they are able leave 
the workplace (i.e., for medical evaluation/care or to return 
home). In the event of a shortage of masks, a reusable face 
shield that can be decontaminated may be an acceptable 
method of protecting against droplet transmission. See CDC/
NIOSH guidance for optimizing respirator supplies, which 
discusses the use of surgical masks, at: 
www.cdc.gov/
coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy
.OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION22 Keep customers informed about symptoms of COVID-19 and 
ask sick customers to minimize contact with workers until 
healthy again, such as by posting signs about COVID-19 in 
stores where sick customers may visit (e.g., pharmacies) or 
including COVID-19 information in automated messages sent 
when prescriptions are ready for pick up.
 Where appropriate, limit customers™ and the public™s access to 
the worksite, or restrict access to only certain workplace areas.
 Consider strategies to minimize face-to-face contact (e.g., drive-
through windows, phone-based communication, telework). 
 Communicate the availability of medical screening or other 
worker health resources (e.g., on-site nurse; telemedicine 
services).
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
When selecting PPE, consider factors such as function, ˜t, 
decontamination ability, disposal, and cost. Sometimes, when 
PPE will have to be used repeatedly for a long period of time, a 
more expensive and durable type of PPE may be less expensive 
overall than disposable PPE. 
Each employer should select 
the combination of PPE that 
protects workers speci˜c to 
their workplace.
Workers with medium 
exposure risk may need to 
wear some combination 
of gloves, a gown, a face 
mask, and/or a face shield 
or goggles. PPE ensembles 
for workers in the medium 
exposure risk category will 
vary by work task, the results 
of the employer™s hazard 
assessment, and the types of 
exposures workers have on 
the job.
High exposure risk jobs 
are those with high 
potential for exposure 
to known or suspected 
sources of COVID-19.
Very high exposure risk
 jobs are those with high 
potential for exposure 
to known or suspected 
sources of COVID-19 
during speci˜c medical, 
postmortem, or laboratory 
procedures that involve 
aerosol generation or 
specimen collection/
handling.

 Ensure appropriate air-handling systems are installed and 
maintained in healthcare facilities. See ﬁGuidelines for 
Environmental Infection Control in Healthcare Facilitiesﬂ for 
more recommendations on air handling systems at: 
www.
cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5210a1.htm
. CDC recommends that patients with known or suspected 
COVID-19 (i.e., person under investigation) should be placed 
in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), if available.
 Use isolation rooms when available for performing 
aerosol-generating procedures on patients with known 
or suspected COVID-19. For postmortem activities, use 
autopsy suites or other similar isolation facilities when 
performing aerosol-generating procedures on the bodies 
of people who are known to have, or suspected of 
having, COVID-19 at the time of their death. See the CDC 
postmortem guidance at: 
www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-

. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION24 Use special precautions associated with Biosafety Level
 3 
when handling specimens from known or suspected 
COVID-19 patients. For more information about biosafety 
levels, consult the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) ﬁBiosafety in Microbiological and 
Biomedical Laboratoriesﬂ at 
www.cdc.gov/biosafety/
publications/bmbl5
.Administrative Controls
If working in a healthcare facility, follow existing guidelines 
and facility standards of practice for identifying and isolating 
infected individuals and for protecting workers. 
 Develop and implement policies that reduce exposure, such 
as cohorting (i.e., grouping) COVID-19 patients when single 
rooms are not available. 
 Post signs requesting patients and family members to 
immediately report symptoms of respiratory illness on 
arrival at the healthcare facility and use disposable face 
masks.
 Consider offering enhanced medical monitoring of workers 
during COVID-19 outbreaks.
 Provide all workers with job-speci˜c education and training 
on preventing transmission of COVID-19, including initial 
and routine/refresher training.
 Ensure that psychological and behavioral support is 
available to address employee stress.
Safe Work Practices
 Provide emergency responders and other essential 
personnel who may be exposed while working away from 
˜xed facilities with alcohol-based hand rubs containing at 
least 60% alcohol for decontamination in the ˜eld. 
GUIDANCE ON PREPARING WORKPLACES FOR COVID-1925Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Most workers at high or very high exposure risk likely need 
to wear gloves, a gown, a face shield or goggles, and either 
a face mask or a respirator, depending on their job tasks and 
exposure risks. 
Those who work closely with (either in contact with or within 
6 feet of) patients known to be, or suspected of being, infected 
with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, should wear 
respirators. In these instances, see the PPE section beginning 
on 
page 
14 of this booklet, which provides more details 
about respirators. For the most up-to-date information, also 
visit OSHA™s COVID-19 webpage: 
www.osha.gov/covid-19
. PPE ensembles may vary, especially for workers in laboratories 
or morgue/mortuary facilities who may need additional 
protection against blood, body ˚uids, chemicals, and other 
materials to which they may be exposed. Additional PPE may 
include medical/surgical gowns, ˚uid-resistant coveralls, 
aprons, or other disposable or reusable protective clothing. 
Gowns should be large enough to cover the areas requiring 
protection. OSHA may also provide updated guidance for PPE 
use on its website: 
www.osha.gov/covid-19
.NOTE: 
Workers who dispose of PPE and other infectious waste 
must also be trained and provided with appropriate PPE.
The CDC webpage ﬁHealthcare-associated Infectionsﬂ 
(www.

infection control in healthcare facilities.
Workers Living Abroad or Travelling 
Internationally
Employers with workers living abroad or traveling on international 
business should consult the ﬁBusiness Travelersﬂ section of the

Employers should communicate to workers that the DOS cannot 
provide Americans traveling or living abroad with medications 
or supplies, even in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.
As COVID-19 outbreak conditions change, travel into or out of 
a country may not be possible, safe, or medically advisable. 
It is also likely that governments will respond to a COVID-19 
outbreak by imposing public health measures that restrict 
domestic and international movement, further limiting the U.S. 
government™s ability to assist Americans in these countries. It 
is important that employers and workers plan appropriately, 
as it is possible that these measures will be implemented 
very quickly in the event of worsening outbreak conditions in 
certain areas. 
More information on COVID-19 planning for workers living and 
traveling abroad can be found at: 
www.cdc.gov/travel
. For More Information
Federal, state, and local government agencies are the best 
source of information in the event of an infectious disease 
outbreak, such as COVID-19. Staying informed about the latest 
developments and recommendations is critical, since speci˜c 
guidance may change based upon evolving outbreak situations.
