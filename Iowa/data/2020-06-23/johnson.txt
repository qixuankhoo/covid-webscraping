   COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. It is mild for most people, but can cause severe illness and result in death for some. Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, have the greatest risk of becoming severely ill. There is no vaccine and no medications approved to treat COVID-19 at this time.Johnson County Public Health is working with local, county, state, and federal partners to keep our community informed about COVID-19. This page provides information, maps, and resources about the coronavirus response in our community.






   Latest Update06/22/2020 16:27
Johnson County Public Health (JCPH) continues to work with the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) and a number of other local agencies to contain the spread of COVID-19 in our community. As of today, Monday, June 22, 2020, there are 773 confirmed positive cases in Johnson County. Five hundred and seventy-nine have recovered from COVID-19, are no longer considered infectious, and are now under the same recommendations as the general public. Currently, there are 26,100 confirmed positive cases in Iowa.Please know while we may feel “over” the novel coronavirus, unfortunately, it is not done with us. Nothing has changed in the way this virus is transmitted. It is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. Infection prevention is key. Recently many more young adults have tested positive for COVID-19.  While we recognize asking well community members to stay home is isolating, the need to protect others is greater, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities, those who are 65 and older, are immunocompromised, have underlying medical conditions or live in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.Businesses and entertainment venues have opened across Iowa, and some people are now considering where to venture out after staying home for months. Society is looking for ways to resume to normal during this unprecedented time, but unfortunately, we are assuming a certain amount of risk for ourselves, and those we are in close contact with at home and work, in all public encounters. We know staying physically six feet away from others, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or elbow, washing hands, not touching your face and wearing a face covering, when done together, will lessen your risk for contracting COVID-19. We urge all businesses to institute these public health measures with staff and patrons and be flexible with allowing staff time off for illnesses. All of us share a great responsibility to protect our fellow residents, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities.People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Mild symptoms may cause many people to think that it is not important to stay home, but it is. Respiratory illnesses can be caused by a variety of viruses, but the community should consider it may be COVID-19 if they have any symptoms and stay home. We appreciate everyone doing their part to stay home when experiencing any symptoms (fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea).Johnson County Public Health has recruited a team of individuals to assist current staff in contact tracing and expanded our capacity to do investigations. We are grateful for the support from our community and appreciate residents understanding the importance of physically distancing six feet from others, wearing a mask, and communicating with us.

What You Can Do to Prevent Illness
There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person:Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.


  Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. Please consult with your health care provider about additional steps you may be able to take to protect yourself.

Frequently Asked Questions



   See also Johnson County's COVID-19 FAQ.See also the CDC's general COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FAQ.



   






What is a novel coronavirus?
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.









What is the source of the virus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.









Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.









What should healthcare professionals and health departments do?
See the FAQ for Healthcare Professionals from the CDC for more information.
