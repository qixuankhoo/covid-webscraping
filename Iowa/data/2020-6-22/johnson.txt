 Frequently Asked Questions in Johnson County
Provided is an explanation on frequent questions or information we are sharing in our community.



 Home



 updated: 04/07/2020, 4:20 PM



 A salon, gym, or other business deemed closed by
Governor Reynold’s under the State of Public Health Disaster Emergency, is
open.  Where do I report this?
Public
Health has no enforcement authority over these closures.  
If you
want to report a business for not following Governor Reynold’s Proclamation,
you can call local law enforcement authorities. 
DO NOT call 911.  

Why are certain places allowed to stay open (craft
stores, sporting goods, factories, etc.)
Currently,
only Governor Reynolds has the legal authority to issue closures. Local elected
officials cannot legally declare a shelter in place order.  

Concerns at work - “My employer isn’t cleaning…” or
“My employer is allowing sick people to come to work…”What can we do to prevent
spread/prepare?  I work in with the
public.  Is it safe to keep going to work?
Everyone
should assume they could potentially encounter someone who is positive for
COVID-19.  This is why social/physical
distancing of at least 6 feet, covering coughs/sneezes, not touching your face
and washing hands is critical. At this time, we should all be monitoring our
health given the evidence of community spread of COVID-19 and staying home if
we experience any symptoms. These
symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure (based on the incubation period of
MERS-CoV viruses) and may include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
We
understand this presents many challenges. 
Point your employer to resources on the IDPH & CDC websites for
businesses.  They recommend employers to
be more flexible with sick leave policies and to increase sanitation
practices.   
https://idph.iowa.gov/Portals/1/userfiles/7/Business%20Guidance%20FAQ%20COVID%2003242020%20%20%281%29.pdf
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html
Cleaning
Guidance
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.html
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/disinfecting-building-facility.html
Have I been exposed? 
Am I at higher risk of contracting COVID-19?  I work with someone who is positive.  I have a friend or family member who is
positive that I was in contact with before/when they were sick from
COVID-19.  Should I get
tested/self-isolate?”
To
consider yourself exposed to the virus you would have to be in close contact –
under 6 feet apart – for more than 2 minutes, while the person had any symptoms.
It may be
possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that
has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly eyes.  However, COVID-19 is thought to primarily spread
through respiratory droplets - someone coughing or sneezing on or near
you.  These droplets can land in the
mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the
sickest). Some spread might be possible from people who are not showing symptoms;
there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this
is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
 
What are the testing guidelines and why didn’t I get
tested?
Not
everyone with symptoms needs a test.  If
you are feeling like you typically do when you have had a cold or the flu, the
best place for you is at home.  Getting a
test will not change this advice.  If
you’re positive and do not have severe symptoms or any underlying medical
conditions, you will likely be told to stay at home, away from others, cleaning
frequently touched surfaces, covering your coughs and sneezes, and washing
hands.  If you have severe symptoms, call
your regular health care provider; do not go into a clinic or hospital without
calling first.  This can spread the virus
if you are in fact positive.If
your health care provider is using the State Hygienic Laboratory for testing
here are their current criteria.  These
may broaden as the pandemic expands and additional testing resources become
available. All hospitalized patients (of any
age) with fever and respiratory illnessOlder adults (>60 years of age)
with fever and respiratory symptoms (cough, difficulty breathing) and chronic
medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, immunosuppressive
medications, chronic lung disease, or chronic kidney disease).Persons of any age with fever or
respiratory illness who live in congregate setting (i.e., long term care
facilities, dormitories, residential facilities, correctional facilities,
treatment facilities)Healthcare workers, essential
services personnel, first responders and critical infrastructure workers with
fever or respiratory illness (ex. healthcare workers, fire and EMS, law
enforcement, residential facility staff)
·      If
your health care provider is using a private lab for testing, the criteria
above might be different.
 
Where do I get accurate information on COVID-19?
Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Iowa Department of Public Health
(IDPH), Johnson County Public Health (JCPH)

The store is out of sanitizer, where can I find hand sanitizer? 

We know
that certain cleaning and hand hygiene products are in limited supply, but
remember soap and water work too.  Avoid
touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Remember to wash your
hands frequently throughout the day. 

Who is considered an essential worker?
Other than
the closures Governor Reynolds has mandated, it is up to your employer to
determine who is essential.  They may
refer to the guidelines at the link below. 
Employers should consider the type of work conducted, what can be done
from home, and if the work can be stopped for a time and restarted.  Rotating shifts, cleaning of frequently
touched surfaces and remaining 6 feet apart should be also be taken into
account.  
There are
different levels of essential workers.  
·        
Healthcare
providers
·        
Law
enforcement
·        
Fire
& EMS personnel
·        
Long
Term Care personnel
·        
Residential
Support Facility personnel
·        
Public
Health & Emergency Management personnel
 
The
advisory list identifies workers who conduct a range of operations and services
that are typically essential to continued critical infrastructure viability,
including staffing operations centers, maintaining and repairing critical
infrastructure, operating call centers, working construction, and performing
operational functions, among others. It also includes workers who support
crucial supply chains and enable functions for critical infrastructure. The
industries they support represent, but are not limited to, medical and
healthcare, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food
and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater,
law enforcement, and public works.
https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce
 
What does community spread mean?
Community
spread means people have been infected with the virus and some are not sure how
or where they became infected. 
 
What does social distancing mean?
Social distancing
is putting physical space between yourself and other people.  Maintain a distance of 6 feet and avoid
gatherings. 
 
What other
things can I do to protect myself? 
Please cover
your cough and wash your hands frequently. Avoid touching your face as much as
possible.  Stay home when you’re sick.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched
surfaces.  Though we encourage people to
stay at home as much as possible, remember that social distancing must be
practiced everywhere.  If you must go out
to the grocery store or pharmacy – maintain the 6 feet, wash your hands.  The goal of social distancing is to limit
your interaction with others who may be ill.

Guidance for childcare providers
The state
has not recommended or ordered childcare closures at this point.  While not often included with first
responders or listed as essential personnel, the service you provide is
critical. Thank you for your public service. We appreciate childcare providers
staying open to provide quality, safe care to Iowa’s children during this
critical time.  IDPH and DHS are in close
consultation on this.  
Right now
guidance is at this link below.  It
offers plans for excluding staff and kids who are ill, cleaning and
communications. If anything changes, it will be posted at this website as
well.

  FAQ


  






   COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. It is mild for most people, but can cause severe illness and result in death for some. Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, have the greatest risk of becoming severely ill. There is no vaccine and no medications approved to treat COVID-19 at this time.Johnson County Public Health is working with local, county, state, and federal partners to keep our community informed about COVID-19. This page provides information, maps, and resources about the coronavirus response in our community.






   Latest Update06/22/2020 16:27
Johnson County Public Health (JCPH) continues to work with the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) and a number of other local agencies to contain the spread of COVID-19 in our community. As of today, Monday, June 22, 2020, there are 773 confirmed positive cases in Johnson County. Five hundred and seventy-nine have recovered from COVID-19, are no longer considered infectious, and are now under the same recommendations as the general public. Currently, there are 26,100 confirmed positive cases in Iowa.Please know while we may feel “over” the novel coronavirus, unfortunately, it is not done with us. Nothing has changed in the way this virus is transmitted. It is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. Infection prevention is key. Recently many more young adults have tested positive for COVID-19.  While we recognize asking well community members to stay home is isolating, the need to protect others is greater, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities, those who are 65 and older, are immunocompromised, have underlying medical conditions or live in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.Businesses and entertainment venues have opened across Iowa, and some people are now considering where to venture out after staying home for months. Society is looking for ways to resume to normal during this unprecedented time, but unfortunately, we are assuming a certain amount of risk for ourselves, and those we are in close contact with at home and work, in all public encounters. We know staying physically six feet away from others, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or elbow, washing hands, not touching your face and wearing a face covering, when done together, will lessen your risk for contracting COVID-19. We urge all businesses to institute these public health measures with staff and patrons and be flexible with allowing staff time off for illnesses. All of us share a great responsibility to protect our fellow residents, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities.People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Mild symptoms may cause many people to think that it is not important to stay home, but it is. Respiratory illnesses can be caused by a variety of viruses, but the community should consider it may be COVID-19 if they have any symptoms and stay home. We appreciate everyone doing their part to stay home when experiencing any symptoms (fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea).Johnson County Public Health has recruited a team of individuals to assist current staff in contact tracing and expanded our capacity to do investigations. We are grateful for the support from our community and appreciate residents understanding the importance of physically distancing six feet from others, wearing a mask, and communicating with us.

What You Can Do to Prevent Illness
There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person:Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.


  Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. Please consult with your health care provider about additional steps you may be able to take to protect yourself.

Frequently Asked Questions



   See also Johnson County's COVID-19 FAQ.See also the CDC's general COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FAQ.



   






What is a novel coronavirus?
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.









What is the source of the virus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.









Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.









What should healthcare professionals and health departments do?
See the FAQ for Healthcare Professionals from the CDC for more information.
