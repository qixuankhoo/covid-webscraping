Test site details



The sites, which will be staffed by members of the Louisiana National Guard, are open for a period of five days per week. The schedule starting June 1 will be Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to approximately noon.

Testing is for open for any Louisiana resident 18 years of age and older with valid Louisiana identification.

Each testing site will be conducted as a drive-thru test site.

Once on site, those being tested will need to wear a mask and stay in their cars for verification of eligibility criteria, ID check and self-administered test. Walk-up testing is not preferred due to safety concerns, but walk-ups will not be turned away.

The site will use a self-administered nasal swab test that will allow those being tested to swab their own nose on site while in their vehicles, observed by a trained medical volunteer to ensure the sample is taken correctly, and drop the sealed sample into a container on their way out of the drive-thru site.

Once received, the Office of Public Health will contact those who were tested to communicate their results and share any necessary information.

While awaiting results, individuals who have been tested should follow CDC guidelines and take steps to help prevent the virus from spreading to people in their home and community.


Dr. Lacey Cavanaugh, the Office of Public Health regional medical director for the five-parish region, encouraged anyone who receives a call from 877-766-2130 to answer, as the call is from a contact tracer. The call is private and your information will not be shared with other people.



"Just by picking up your phone and speaking with a contact tracer, you're helping to protect yourself and others by identifying those you have been in close contact with. This helps us to quickly identify and contain spread of the virus,” she said.



Contact tracing is crucial as Louisiana eases restrictions on businesses and activities. Contact tracing works as follows: When someone tests positive, a contact tracer will try to call everyone who came in close contact with the COVID-positive person. Everyone called by a contact tracer is advised to watch themselves for signs of illness for 14 days from when they first came in contact with the COVID-19 person.



If a resource need is identified through the contact tracing interview, the case is flagged for follow-up from a resource coordinator social worker who can connect individuals with a wide assortment of available resources. These can include medication, masks, food assistance and even help locating alternative housing.



If someone calls from a number other than 877-766-2130, claims to be a contact tracer and asks for personal information, hang up immediately.

Calcasieu Parish Waterworks Lifts Boil Advisory for Portion of District No. 5
Post Date:
06/09/2020






UPDATE: This boil advisory has been lifted.


Calcasieu Waterworks District No. 5 of Wards 3 and 8 has issued a boil advisory, effective immediately, for Highway 397 south of Farm Road, McNeese Street, parts of Clearfield Subdivision and the Oak Grove and Highland Hills subdivisions. 


The reason for the advisory is disruption to water service due to water main improvements. It is recommended that all residents in the affected area disinfect their water before consuming it (including fountain drinks), making ice, brushing teeth, or using it for food preparation by boiling water for one full minute in a clean container. The one minute starts after the water has been brought to a rolling boil. The water’s flat taste can be eliminated by shaking the water in a clean bottle, pouring it from one clean container to another, or by adding a small pinch of salt to each quart of water that is boiled.


The water district will rescind this boil advisory once it’s given the all clear from the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals’ Office of Public Health.


If you have any questions, contact Waterworks
 
District 5 at 337-721-3754.

Post Date:
05/22/2020






The Old Highway 90 Boat Launch is now open.

This launch is now something we can all be proud of and take ownership of. I really hope folks take care of it like it was their own.”
